                <!-- Section 1: Overview -->
                <h2 id="overview-title">Ontario Security Guard Licensing Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    Working as a security guard in Ontario is regulated under the <strong>Private Security and Investigative Services Act, 2005 (PSISA)</strong>, administered by the <strong>Ministry of the Solicitor General</strong>. You <strong>must</strong> have a valid licence to work as a security guard anywhere in Ontario. It is illegal for both the individual and the employer to engage in security work without proper licensing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Ontario security guard licence is valid for <strong>two years</strong> from the date of issue, after which it must be renewed. There are two distinct types of licences under PSISA: a <strong>Security Guard licence</strong> for guarding duties such as patrols, access control, and monitoring, and a <strong>Private Investigator licence</strong> for conducting investigations, surveillance, and background checks. Each requires its own training program and test. This guide focuses on the Security Guard licence, which is the most common starting point for people entering the industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The security industry in the Greater Toronto Area is one of the largest employers for newcomers to Canada, career changers, and people looking for steady shift work. With thousands of condominiums, corporate offices, construction sites, and event venues across the GTA, licensed security guards are always in demand. Earning your licence is the first step toward a career that offers stable employment, flexible shifts, and clear opportunities for advancement.
                </p>

                <!-- Section 2: Requirements Checklist -->
                <h2>Requirements to Get Your Licence</h2>

                <p>
                    Before you can apply for an Ontario security guard licence, you must meet the following requirements. Make sure you can check off every item on this list before beginning the training process.
                </p>

                <ul class="checklist">
                    <li>Be at least 18 years old</li>
                    <li>Be legally entitled to work in Canada (permanent resident, citizen, or valid work permit)</li>
                    <li>Have no criminal record (or obtain a pardon/record suspension before applying)</li>
                    <li>Complete the mandatory 40-hour training course from an approved provider</li>
                    <li>Pass the Serco DES ministry test</li>
                    <li>Submit your application to the Ministry of the Solicitor General</li>
                    <li>Pay the application fee ($80)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box tip">
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you are unsure whether a past criminal conviction will affect your eligibility, contact the Ministry of the Solicitor General directly before paying for the training course. They can advise you on your specific situation and save you from spending money unnecessarily.
                </div>

                <!-- Section 3: Step-by-Step Process -->
                <h2>Step-by-Step Licensing Process</h2>

                <p>
                    Here is the complete process for obtaining your Ontario security guard licence, from training through to receiving your licence card.
                </p>

                <ol class="step-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Complete the 40-hour training course.</strong> The mandatory training program covers legal authority and responsibilities of a security guard, use of force theory and application, report writing and note-taking, emergency response procedures, communication and conflict resolution, and first aid basics. You can complete the course in person over five consecutive days or through approved online and hybrid programs. Choose a training provider approved by the Ministry of the Solicitor General.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Book and pass the Serco DES test.</strong> After completing your training, book your ministry-administered licensing exam through Serco DES. The test is multiple choice and covers all material from the 40-hour course. You need a minimum score of <strong>60%</strong> to pass. The test fee is <strong>$66.40</strong>. Test centres are located across Ontario, including multiple locations in the GTA. Results are provided electronically to the Ministry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Gather your documents.</strong> Before submitting your application, you will need your training certificate from the approved provider, your Serco DES test results (sent electronically), a valid government-issued photo ID, and a criminal record check from your local police service. Some police services offer online applications for criminal record checks, which can speed up the process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Apply online through ServiceOntario.</strong> Submit your licence application through the ServiceOntario online portal. The application fee is <strong>$80</strong>. You will need to upload your documents and provide consent for a background check conducted by the Ministry. Make sure all information matches your government ID exactly to avoid processing delays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wait for processing.</strong> The Ministry of the Solicitor General typically takes <strong>4&ndash;6 weeks</strong> to process applications. During this time, your background check is conducted and your documents are verified. Some employers will hire you while you are waiting for your licence if you can provide proof of training completion and a passing Serco DES score, though you cannot legally perform guarding duties until the licence is issued.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Receive your licence card.</strong> Once approved, you will receive your Ontario security guard licence card in the mail. Carry it with you at all times while on duty. Your licence is valid for two years from the date of issue. Mark your calendar to begin the renewal process at least 60 days before expiry.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <!-- Section 4: Costs & Timeline -->
                <h2>Training Costs &amp; Timeline</h2>

                <div class="info-box cost">
                    <strong>Total Cost Breakdown:</strong> Training course: $200&ndash;400 | Serco DES test: $66.40 | Ministry application: $80 | Criminal record check: $20&ndash;65 | Total: approximately $370&ndash;610
                </div>

                <p>
                    The cost of getting your Ontario security guard licence varies depending on which training provider you choose and where you obtain your criminal record check. Budget-friendly training schools in the GTA offer the 40-hour course for as low as $200, while more established schools with in-person facilities and additional resources may charge up to $400. The Serco DES test fee of $66.40 and the Ministry application fee of $80 are fixed costs that every applicant pays.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of timeline, the 40-hour training course takes <strong>1&ndash;2 weeks</strong> to complete depending on whether you choose a full-time weekday schedule (typically five consecutive days) or a part-time weekend schedule (two to three weekends). The Serco DES test can usually be booked within a few days of completing your training, and you will receive your results immediately after the exam. Ministry processing takes <strong>4&ndash;6 weeks</strong> on average, though it can occasionally be faster or slower depending on application volume.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some employers in the GTA will hire you while you are waiting for your licence to be processed, provided you can show proof of your training certificate and Serco DES pass confirmation. This means you could potentially start earning within 2&ndash;3 weeks of beginning your training, even before your physical licence card arrives. However, you should confirm this with each specific employer, as policies vary.

                    The Greater Toronto Area has numerous training schools that offer the mandatory 40-hour security guard course. For residents of Rexdale, Etobicoke, and northwest Toronto, there are several convenient options within a short commute.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When choosing a training provider, make sure the school is <strong>approved by the Ministry of the Solicitor General</strong>. Only training from an approved provider will be accepted for your licence application. Ask about class sizes, instructor experience, and whether the school provides assistance with booking your Serco DES test. Some schools also help with the Ministry application process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Schedule options</strong> include full-time weekday courses that run Monday through Friday for one week, weekend courses that meet on Saturdays and Sundays over two to three weekends, evening courses for people who are currently working during the day, and online or hybrid courses that combine self-paced online learning with in-person practical components. The hybrid online and in-person model has become increasingly popular and allows you to complete much of the coursework on your own schedule before attending a shorter in-person session for the practical elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Training schools in the GTA are concentrated in areas like North York, Scarborough, Mississauga, and downtown Toronto. Many are accessible by TTC bus routes from Rexdale, or by a short drive along Highway 27 or the 401. Compare prices, read reviews from former students, and confirm that the school's schedule works for your availability before enrolling. Some community organizations and employment centres in the GTA also offer subsidized or free security guard training for eligible job seekers, particularly newcomers to Canada and people receiving employment assistance.

Always have your training certificate and Serco DES pass confirmation ready to show prospective employers.</p>

                            <p>A criminal record does not automatically disqualify you, but it is a factor the Ministry considers. Minor or older offences may not prevent licensing, while serious convictions involving violence, theft, or fraud are more likely to result in a denial. The Ministry conducts a background check on every applicant. If you have a record, consider applying for a record suspension (pardon) through the Parole Board of Canada before starting the licensing process. Contact the Ministry directly to discuss your specific situation before investing in training.</p>

                            <p>Your licence is valid for two years. To renew, submit a renewal application and the $80 fee to the Ministry of the Solicitor General before your licence expires. You do not need to retake the training course or the Serco DES test for a standard renewal. If your licence has been expired for more than 12 months, you may need to retake both. Start the renewal process at least 60 days before your expiry date to avoid any gap in your ability to work.</p>

                            <p>Under Ontario's PSISA, these are two separate licences with different scopes. A security guard licence covers guarding duties such as access control, patrols, monitoring, and protecting property or persons. A private investigator licence is required for investigations, surveillance, background checks, and skip tracing. Each has its own training program and Serco DES test. Some professionals hold both licences to broaden their career options and service offerings.</p>
