            <h2>Security Work in the Greater Toronto Area</h2>
            <p>Security is one of the most common employment paths in the GTA, particularly for newcomers to Canada, career changers, and people looking for steady shift work. The Greater Toronto Area has an enormous demand for licensed security guards, driven by the ongoing construction boom, a growing number of condominium buildings, a busy events calendar, and corporate offices that require around-the-clock coverage.</p>
            <p>The Etobicoke and Rexdale area is especially well-positioned for security work. Its proximity to Pearson International Airport, the Woodbine Entertainment complex, large distribution centres along Highway 27, and dozens of new condo developments along the Humber River corridor means there are always employers looking for reliable guards. Many of the largest security companies in Ontario, including GardaWorld, Paladin Security, Securitas, and G4S, actively recruit for sites in western Toronto.</p>

            <h2>Types of Security Jobs in the GTA</h2>
            <p>Security work is far more varied than most people realize. Here are the most common types of security positions you will find in Toronto and Etobicoke.</p>

            <div class="job-types-grid">
                <div class="job-type-card">
                    <h4>Condo & Residential Security</h4>
                    <span class="pay-range">$17 – $20/hr</span>
                    <p>Monitor lobbies, manage visitor access, handle package deliveries, and conduct building patrols. Condo concierge security is one of the most common entry-level roles. Many buildings in Etobicoke and downtown Toronto hire guards on 12-hour continental rotations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="job-type-card">
                    <h4>Event Security</h4>
                    <span class="pay-range">$17 – $22/hr</span>
                    <p>Work at concerts, sporting events, festivals, and corporate gatherings. Responsibilities include crowd management, bag checks, access control, and emergency response. Toronto's busy event scene means consistent seasonal demand, especially from May through October.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="job-type-card">
                    <h4>Retail Loss Prevention</h4>

                    <p>Prevent theft and monitor surveillance cameras at retail locations. Loss prevention officers patrol store floors, watch for suspicious behaviour, and work closely with store management. Major retailers at Woodbine Centre and Sherway Gardens regularly hire LP staff.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="job-type-card">

                    <p>Drive between multiple client sites conducting security checks, alarm response, and lockup/unlock services. Mobile patrol officers need a valid G license and a clean driving abstract. This role offers variety and independence compared to static guard positions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="job-type-card">
                    <h4>Corporate Security</h4>
                    <span class="pay-range">$19 – $25/hr</span>
                    <p>Provide access control, reception security, and emergency coordination at office towers, banks, and government buildings. Corporate sites tend to pay higher wages and often require additional screening, such as enhanced reliability clearances or CPIC checks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="job-type-card">
                    <h4>Construction Site Security</h4>

                    <p>Guard active construction sites overnight and on weekends to prevent theft of materials and equipment. These roles are plentiful across the GTA given the number of active development projects. Night shifts and weekend availability are typically required.</p>

            <h2>How to Get Your Security Guard License in Ontario</h2>
            <p>Working as a security guard in Ontario is regulated under the <strong>Private Security and Investigative Services Act, 2005 (PSISA)</strong>. You cannot legally work a security position without holding a valid license issued by the <strong>Ministry of the Solicitor General</strong>. Here is how the process works.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Meet the Basic Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong></li>
                <li>Be legally entitled to work in Canada (citizen, permanent resident, or valid work permit)</li>
                <li>Have no criminal convictions that would prevent licensing (a background check is part of the application)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Complete the Mandatory Training</h3>
            <p>You must complete a <strong>40-hour training program</strong> from a provider approved by the Ministry of the Solicitor General. The curriculum covers the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduction to the security industry and the PSISA</li>
                <li>Legal authorities and responsibilities of a security guard</li>
                <li>Effective communication and conflict resolution</li>
                <li>Use of force theory and application</li>
                <li>Emergency response procedures</li>
                <li>Report writing and note-taking</li>
                <li>Health and safety awareness</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Training can be completed in person or through approved online programs. In-person courses are typically offered over five consecutive days. Costs range from <strong>$150 to $350</strong> depending on the provider. Several training schools operate in the Etobicoke and North York areas, making it convenient for Rexdale residents.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Pass the Licensing Test</h3>
            <p>After completing your training, you must pass a written multiple-choice test administered by <strong>Serco DES</strong> on behalf of the province. The test fee is approximately <strong>$66.50</strong>. Test centres are located across Ontario, including multiple locations in the GTA. The test covers all material from the mandatory training curriculum. You need a score of at least <strong>65%</strong> to pass.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Apply for Your License</h3>
            <p>Once you pass the test, submit your application to the Ministry of the Solicitor General. You will need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your test results (provided electronically by Serco DES)</li>
                <li>A recent passport-style photograph</li>
                <li>The <strong>$80 licensing fee</strong></li>
                <li>Consent for a criminal background check</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Processing typically takes <strong>2 to 6 weeks</strong>. Once approved, your security guard license is valid for <strong>two years</strong> from the date of issue, after which it must be renewed.</p>

            <h3>Additional Certifications That Help</h3>
            <p>While not legally required for licensing, most Toronto employers expect or require the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard First Aid with CPR-C</strong> &mdash; A two-day course costing $100&ndash;$130. Required by virtually all security companies.</li>
                <li><strong>Valid G driver's license</strong> &mdash; Essential for mobile patrol roles and helpful for reaching remote job sites.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Force certification</strong> &mdash; Some employers require refresher training beyond what the basic course covers.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerable Sector Check</strong> &mdash; Needed for security positions at hospitals, schools, and care facilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security Jobs With No Experience</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of the security industry is that <strong>many employers will hire you with no previous experience</strong>, provided you hold a valid Ontario security guard license. Security companies understand that every guard starts somewhere, and many have structured training programs for new hires.</p>
            <p>The easiest entry points for new guards are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Condo and residential buildings</strong> &mdash; These sites typically have lower risk profiles and provide a good learning environment for new guards. Duties are routine: access control, visitor management, and regular patrols.</li>
                <li><strong>Construction site security</strong> &mdash; Overnight and weekend construction site guarding is straightforward work that involves monitoring the perimeter and deterring trespassers. Companies are often willing to place new guards at these sites.</li>
                <li><strong>Event security</strong> &mdash; Large events need dozens of guards at once, and staffing companies regularly bring on newly licensed workers to fill these positions. It is a great way to build hours quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Retail loss prevention</strong> &mdash; Some retail chains will hire new guards who demonstrate strong observation skills and a professional demeanour.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To improve your chances as a new guard, make sure your resume highlights any customer service experience, volunteer work, or military/cadet background. Reliability and professionalism matter more than years on the job at the entry level.</p>

            <h2>Career Growth in Security</h2>
            <p>Security is not just a starting point &mdash; it can be a long-term career with meaningful advancement. Here is what a typical growth path looks like in the GTA security industry.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security Guard (Year 1&ndash;2)</strong> &mdash; Start at entry-level static sites earning $17&ndash;$20/hr. Focus on building a reliable track record and learning the fundamentals of site management.</li>
                <li><strong>Senior Guard / Shift Lead (Year 2&ndash;4)</strong> &mdash; Take on responsibility for coordinating other guards, managing incident reports, and liaising with clients. Pay increases to $20&ndash;$24/hr.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Patrol / Alarm Response (Year 1&ndash;3)</strong> &mdash; Transition to mobile roles for more independence and higher pay at $18&ndash;$22/hr. Requires a clean driving record.</li>
                <li><strong>Site Supervisor (Year 3&ndash;5)</strong> &mdash; Oversee an entire security team at a major site. Supervisors handle scheduling, client relations, and incident management. Compensation ranges from $24&ndash;$30/hr.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Manager / Operations Manager</strong> &mdash; Move into management with security companies. Salaried roles typically range from $55,000 to $80,000 per year. A diploma or degree in security management, criminal justice, or business helps at this level.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some guards also pursue specialized roles such as <strong>close protection (bodyguard)</strong> work, <strong>cybersecurity consulting</strong>, <strong>private investigation</strong>, or transition into <strong>law enforcement</strong> or <strong>bylaw enforcement</strong> careers. The skills you develop in security &mdash; situational awareness, conflict de-escalation, report writing, and professionalism under pressure &mdash; are valued across many fields.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How do I get a security guard license in Ontario?<svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button>
                <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">You need to complete a 40-hour training course from a Ministry-approved provider, pass the licensing test administered by Serco DES, and submit your application to the Ministry of the Solicitor General with the $80 fee. The entire process typically takes 4 to 8 weeks. You must be at least 18 years old and legally entitled to work in Canada.</div></div>

                <button class="faq-question">Can I get a security job in Toronto with no experience?<svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button>
                <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Yes. Many security companies in Toronto and Etobicoke hire newly licensed guards with no prior security experience. Condo buildings, construction sites, and event security are the most common entry points for new guards. Having Standard First Aid with CPR-C and a clean background check will strengthen your application considerably.</div></div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">How much do security guards earn in the Toronto area?<svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button>
                <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Most security guards in the GTA earn between $17 and $22 per hour. Condo and construction site guards typically start at $17&ndash;$19/hr, while corporate and government security roles can pay $20&ndash;$25/hr. Night and weekend shifts often include a shift premium of $1&ndash;$2/hr. Supervisors and mobile patrol officers earn $22&ndash;$28/hr.</div></div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">Do I need first aid certification to work as a security guard?<svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button>
                <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Standard First Aid with CPR-C is not a legal requirement for the Ontario security guard license itself, but nearly all employers require it as a condition of hiring. The course takes about two days to complete, costs between $100 and $130, and the certification is valid for three years. It is strongly recommended to complete this before applying for security positions.</div></div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What is the difference between a security guard and a private investigator license?<svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button>
                <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Under Ontario's Private Security and Investigative Services Act (PSISA), these are two separate licenses. A security guard license authorizes you to perform guarding duties such as patrols, access control, and monitoring. A private investigator license is required for conducting investigations, surveillance, and skip tracing. Each has its own training program and test. Some professionals hold both licenses to increase their employability.</div></div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">How long is the Ontario security guard license valid for?<svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button>
                <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">The Ontario security guard license is valid for two years from the date it is issued. To renew, you must submit a renewal application and fee before it expires. If your license lapses, you may need to retake the training course and licensing test. It is important to set a reminder and begin the renewal process at least 60 days before your expiry date.</div></div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What shifts are available for security guards in Toronto?<svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"></path></svg></button>
                <div class="faq-answer"><div class="faq-answer-inner">Security is a 24/7 industry. The standard shifts are days (7am&ndash;3pm), afternoons (3pm&ndash;11pm), and nights (11pm&ndash;7am). Many condo and corporate sites use 12-hour continental shift rotations, which means you work a pattern of day and night shifts with built-in days off. Overnight and weekend guards are always in high demand, and these shifts often come with a small pay premium.</div></div>
