Popular retailers with frequent openings include Winners, H&M, Dollarama, Sport Chek, Bath & Body Works, and Old Navy. The food court also has multiple restaurants hiring for cashier, food prep, and kitchen helper roles. Seasonal kiosks open during the holiday season and back-to-school period, creating additional short-term positions. Mall-level employers also hire for security, maintenance, and guest services.

The most effective approach is to walk into the mall with printed copies of your resume and hand them directly to store managers or shift supervisors. Visit during weekday mornings (Tuesday through Thursday, 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM) when managers are most likely to be available and the mall is less busy. You can also apply online through individual retailer career portals such as walmart.ca/careers, careers.hm.com, or winners.ca/careers. For food court positions, walk-in applications are generally preferred. Dress neatly and be prepared for a brief on-the-spot interview, as some managers hire immediately when they have urgent staffing needs."

Starting pay is generally $16.55 to $18 per hour. Turnover in food court positions is relatively high, so openings come up frequently throughout the year.

                <h2 id="content-heading">Working at Woodbine Mall &amp; Surrounding Plazas</h2>
                <p><strong>Woodbine Centre</strong> (commonly known as Woodbine Mall) sits at the intersection of Rexdale Boulevard and Highway 27 in Etobicoke, making it one of the most accessible shopping destinations in Toronto's west end. The mall itself houses over 100 stores and services, a bustling food court, and a variety of entertainment and personal service businesses. For job seekers in Rexdale and north Etobicoke, Woodbine Mall and the surrounding plazas represent one of the densest concentrations of retail and food service employment in the area.</p>

                <p>Getting to the mall by public transit is straightforward. TTC bus routes <strong>36 Finch West</strong>, <strong>96 Wilson</strong>, <strong>37 Islington</strong>, and the <strong>191 Highway 27 Rocket</strong> all stop directly at or within a short walk of the mall. For workers without a car, this accessibility makes Woodbine Mall one of the most practical employment locations in the neighbourhood.</p>

                <p>Inside the mall, major retailers like <strong>Winners</strong>, <strong>Dollarama</strong>, and <strong>H&amp;M</strong> are among the most frequent hirers, along with a diverse mix of food court restaurants, specialty shops, and service providers. Grocery stores in the surrounding plazas, including <strong>FreshCo</strong>, add to the employment options. The surrounding retail corridor along Rexdale Boulevard and Highway 27 includes big-box employers such as <strong>Canadian Tire</strong>, <strong>Walmart</strong>, and <strong>Shoppers Drug Mart</strong>, all within walking distance of the mall.</p>

                <p>Hiring at Woodbine Mall follows a seasonal pattern. The two biggest surges come in <strong>September</strong> for back-to-school season and <strong>November through December</strong> for the holiday rush. During these periods, nearly every store in the mall and surrounding plazas adds temporary staff to handle the increased customer traffic. Many of these seasonal positions lead to permanent roles for workers who perform well.</p>

                <!-- How to Get Hired -->
                <h2>How to Get Hired at Woodbine Mall</h2>
                <p>Landing a job at Woodbine Mall or the surrounding plazas is often more straightforward than many people expect. Unlike corporate office positions that require lengthy online applications, many retail and food service employers at the mall still value the walk-in approach. Here is what works best.</p>

                <h3>Walk In With Your Resume</h3>
                <p>Print several clean copies of your resume and visit the mall in person. Walk into each store you are interested in, ask to speak with the manager or shift supervisor, and hand them your resume directly. This face-to-face approach gives you an immediate advantage over online-only applicants because the manager can put a face to your name. Be polite, make eye contact, and briefly explain that you are looking for work and are available to start right away.</p>

                <h3>Check Store Windows for Help Wanted Signs</h3>
                <p>Many stores at Woodbine Mall post <strong>"Help Wanted"</strong> or <strong>"Now Hiring"</strong> signs in their front windows or near the entrance. Take a walk through the mall and make note of every store with a hiring sign. These businesses have an immediate need, which means the hiring process is often faster. Some managers will interview you on the spot if they are not busy.</p>

                <h3>Apply Online Through Retailer Career Pages</h3>
                <p>For larger chain stores like Winners, H&amp;M, Dollarama, Canadian Tire, and Walmart, online applications through their corporate career websites are the standard process. Search for openings at the specific Woodbine Mall or Rexdale Boulevard location. After submitting your online application, follow up with an in-person visit to show initiative. This dual approach significantly increases your chances of getting called for an interview.</p>

                <h3>Dress Presentably for Walk-In Applications</h3>
                <p>First impressions matter in retail. When dropping off your resume, dress in clean, neat, business-casual clothing. You do not need a suit, but avoid ripped jeans, athletic wear, or clothing with large logos. Looking presentable signals to the hiring manager that you take the opportunity seriously and would represent their store well to customers.</p>

                <h3>Best Times to Apply</h3>
                <p>The best times to drop off resumes are <strong>weekday mornings between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM</strong>, Tuesday through Thursday. This is when store managers and assistant managers are most likely to be on the floor and available to speak with you. Avoid weekends, Monday mornings, and Friday afternoons, as these tend to be the busiest times when managers are focused on customer traffic and are less likely to have time for walk-in applicants.</p>

                <!-- Surrounding Employers -->

                <!-- Seasonal & Holiday Hiring -->
                <h2>Seasonal &amp; Holiday Hiring at Woodbine</h2>
                <p>The holiday season is the single biggest hiring period at Woodbine Mall and the surrounding retail area. Understanding the timeline and types of roles available can give you a significant advantage over other applicants.</p>

                <h3>When to Apply for Holiday Season Jobs</h3>
                <p>The ideal time to start applying for holiday season positions is <strong>September through mid-October</strong>. Many retailers begin posting seasonal openings as early as Labour Day weekend. By late October, most stores have already filled their holiday staffing needs, so early applicants have the best selection of shifts and roles. Do not wait until November &mdash; by then, the best positions are already taken.</p>

                <h3>Types of Seasonal Roles</h3>
                <p>Holiday seasonal positions at Woodbine Mall include additional cashiers to handle longer checkout lines, stock associates to manage the increased volume of shipments, gift wrappers at select retailers, seasonal sales associates to assist the surge of holiday shoppers, and temporary food court staff to serve the higher foot traffic. Some stores also add greeter or customer service positions specifically for the holiday period.</p>

                <h3>Potential for Permanent Conversion</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest advantages of seasonal work at Woodbine Mall is the potential to convert to a permanent position. Retailers invest time and resources in training seasonal staff, and they prefer to keep reliable workers rather than hiring from scratch again in January. If you demonstrate punctuality, a positive attitude, strong customer service skills, and a willingness to take on extra shifts during the busiest days (Black Friday, Boxing Day), your chances of being offered a permanent part-time or full-time role increase significantly. Many current year-round employees at Woodbine Mall started as holiday seasonal hires.</p>

                            There are several ways to apply for jobs at Woodbine Centre. The most effective approach is to walk into the mall with printed copies of your resume and hand them directly to store managers or shift supervisors. Visit during weekday mornings (Tuesday through Thursday, 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM) when managers are most likely to be available and the mall is less busy. You can also apply online through individual retailer career portals such as walmart.ca/careers, careers.hm.com, or winners.ca/careers. For food court positions, walk-in applications are generally preferred. Dress neatly and be prepared for a brief on-the-spot interview, as some managers hire immediately when they have urgent staffing needs.

                            Yes, the Woodbine Mall food court is one of the best sources of part-time and entry-level jobs in the area. Multiple restaurants and quick-service outlets hire for cashier, food preparation, kitchen helper, and cleaning roles. Food court jobs are especially popular with students and newcomers to Canada because they typically require no prior experience, offer flexible scheduling, and provide on-the-job training. Starting pay is generally $16.55 to $18 per hour. Turnover in food court positions is relatively high, so openings come up frequently throughout the year. Walk in with a resume and ask to speak with the manager during a non-peak time, such as mid-morning on a weekday.
