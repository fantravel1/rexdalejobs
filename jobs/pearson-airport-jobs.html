            <!-- Overview -->
            <h2>Why Pearson Airport Is Rexdale's Biggest Job Engine</h2>
            <p>Toronto Pearson International Airport (IATA: YYZ) sits on the western edge of Toronto, directly adjacent to Rexdale and the Etobicoke industrial corridor. As Canada's busiest airport, Pearson handles over 50 million passengers annually and employs approximately 50,000 people across its two terminals, cargo facilities, maintenance hangars, and surrounding airport lands. For Rexdale residents, this is arguably the single most important employment hub within reach.</p>

            <p>The airport's workforce spans a vast range of roles, from airside operations and security to retail, food service, and logistics. Major ground handling companies such as Swissport, Menzies Aviation, and GTA DNata hire hundreds of baggage handlers and ramp agents every year. Airlines including Air Canada, WestJet, and Porter operate crew bases at Pearson. The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), which manages the airport, also hires directly for operations, maintenance, and administration roles.</p>

            <p>What makes Pearson especially valuable for job seekers in Rexdale is proximity. Most parts of Rexdale are a 10-to-20-minute drive from the airport, and public transit connections are improving. Unlike many jobs in downtown Toronto that require long commutes, airport work is practically next door. The 24-hour nature of airport operations also means there are shifts available around the clock, making it possible to work around other commitments like school or family responsibilities.</p>

            <!-- How to Apply -->
            <h2>How to Apply for Pearson Airport Jobs</h2>
            <p>Getting hired at the airport follows a process that is a bit different from other jobs due to the security requirements involved. Here is a step-by-step overview of what to expect.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Find Open Positions</h3>
            <p>Start by checking the career pages of major airport employers. The GTAA posts positions on <strong>torontopearson.com/careers</strong>. Ground handling companies like Swissport, Menzies, and GTA DNata list openings on their own websites and on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn. Staffing agencies such as Randstad, Adecco, and Express Employment also recruit for airport roles and can be a faster route to getting hired.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Apply Online</h3>
            <p>Most applications are submitted online. Prepare a simple resume highlighting any physical labour, customer service, or warehouse experience you have. If you are applying for a role requiring bilingual skills, make sure to list your language abilities prominently. Tailor your resume to the specific position and mention your proximity to the airport if you live in Rexdale or nearby areas.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Interview</h3>
            <p>For high-volume positions like baggage handlers and cleaning staff, employers often conduct group interviews or hiring events. These are typically held at the airport or at nearby hotels and conference centres. Dress professionally, bring government-issued photo ID, and be ready to discuss your availability for shift work including weekends and holidays.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Security Clearance and RAIC</h3>
            <p>After receiving a conditional job offer, you must undergo a <strong>Transport Canada security background check</strong>. This includes a criminal record check and may involve a credit check. You will then apply for a <strong>Restricted Area Identity Card (RAIC)</strong>, which grants access to secure areas of the airport. The process involves fingerprinting, a photograph, and mandatory security awareness training. Expect this step to take 4 to 8 weeks. Your employer sponsors and typically pays for your RAIC.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Training and Onboarding</h3>
            <p>Once your RAIC is issued, you will complete job-specific training provided by your employer. This may include airside safety training (how to work safely around aircraft), equipment operation training, customer service protocols, or security screening procedures depending on your role. Some positions require you to pass a physical fitness assessment.</p>

            <!-- Getting to Pearson from Rexdale -->
            <h2>Getting to Pearson from Rexdale</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages for Rexdale residents is the short commute to the airport. Here are the main ways to get there.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>TTC Bus Routes:</strong> The 52 Lawrence West bus connects to the airport area. The 36 Finch West and 96 Wilson routes also provide connections with transfers to airport-bound services.</li>
                <li><strong>MiWay (Mississauga Transit):</strong> Route 7 connects to the airport from the Mississauga side, useful if you live in the western part of Rexdale near the city boundary.</li>
                <li><strong>UP Express:</strong> If you are coming from other parts of Toronto, the UP Express runs from Union Station to Pearson Terminal 1 in 25 minutes, with stops at Bloor and Weston.</li>
                <li><strong>Employer Shuttles:</strong> Many airport employers operate free shuttle buses from nearby transit hubs and parking areas to their work sites within the airport campus.</li>
                <li><strong>Driving:</strong> From Rexdale Boulevard, the airport is accessible via Highway 427 South or Airport Road. The drive is typically 10 to 20 minutes outside of rush hour. Some employers offer free employee parking; others provide discounted parking passes.</li>
                <li><strong>Cycling:</strong> Cycling infrastructure to the airport is limited but improving. Some employees cycle to nearby transit hubs and use a combination of bike and bus to reach their terminals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important: Plan Around Shift Times</h3>
            <p>Early morning shifts (starting at 4:00 or 5:00 AM) can be challenging with public transit since bus frequency is lower at that hour. Many workers in early-morning roles carpool with coworkers or drive. If you are relying on transit, check the TTC and MiWay schedules carefully for your specific shift time before accepting a position.</p>

            <!-- Additional Content: What to Know Before You Start -->
            <h2>What to Know Before Starting an Airport Job</h2>

            <h3>Shift Work Is the Norm</h3>
            <p>The airport never closes. Flights depart as early as 6:00 AM and arrive as late as 1:00 AM, with cargo operations running through the night. Most airport jobs require rotating shifts and weekend availability. The upside is that overnight and weekend shifts usually come with a pay premium of $1 to $3 per hour on top of your base rate.</p>

            <h3>The RAIC Card Is Non-Negotiable</h3>
            <p>Any role that requires you to enter restricted areas of the airport requires a valid RAIC. This is issued by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and involves biometric enrolment (fingerprints and iris scans). If your security check is denied, typically due to a criminal record, you will not be able to work in restricted areas. Some non-restricted roles exist (certain retail positions, for example), but the majority of airport jobs need RAIC access.</p>

            <h3>Physical Demands</h3>
            <p>Many airport jobs, particularly baggage handling, ramp operations, and cargo work, are physically demanding. You may be required to lift up to 70 lbs repeatedly, work outdoors in all weather conditions (Canadian winters on the tarmac are no joke), and stand for extended periods. Proper safety footwear (steel-toed boots) is typically required and sometimes provided or subsidized by the employer.</p>

            <h3>Unionized vs. Non-Unionized Roles</h3>
            <p>Many ground handling and cleaning positions at Pearson are unionized through organizations like Unifor or the International Association of Machinists (IAM). Unionized roles generally offer higher wages, better benefits (dental, vision, extended health), seniority-based scheduling, and job protection. When evaluating offers, consider whether the position is unionized, as this can significantly impact your long-term compensation and working conditions.</p>

                        <p>Several positions at Toronto Pearson Airport require no prior experience. Terminal cleaning and janitorial roles, baggage handler positions, food service and retail jobs within the terminals, parking lot attendants, and general labour in cargo warehouses are all commonly available to first-time applicants. Employers provide on-the-job training for these roles. You will still need to pass a security background check and obtain a RAIC card, but no previous airport or industry experience is needed. Starting wages for these entry-level positions typically range from $17 to $20 per hour.</p>

                        <p>A Restricted Area Identity Card (RAIC) is required for any job involving access to secure areas at the airport. You cannot apply for a RAIC on your own; your employer must sponsor your application after you receive a job offer. The process involves completing a Transport Canada security clearance form, providing fingerprints and a photograph, passing a criminal background check, and attending a mandatory security awareness training course. The entire process typically takes 4 to 8 weeks. Your employer covers the cost in most cases. The RAIC is valid for up to 5 years and must be renewed before it expires.</p>

                        <p>Baggage handlers at Toronto Pearson typically earn between $17 and $22 per hour, depending on the employer and your experience level. Ramp agents, who handle a broader range of airside duties including marshalling aircraft and operating ground support equipment, earn between $18 and $24 per hour. Both positions often include shift premiums for overnight and weekend work, adding $1 to $3 per hour to your base rate. Major ground handling employers at YYZ include Swissport, Menzies Aviation, and GTA DNata. Unionized positions generally offer higher wages, better benefits, and more predictable pay increases.</p>

                        <p>Yes, Pearson Airport is very accessible from Rexdale by public transit. The TTC 52 Lawrence West bus connects to the airport area, and several other routes provide connections with transfers. MiWay Route 7 is useful if you live near the Mississauga border. The UP Express runs from Union Station in 25 minutes with stops at Bloor and Weston. Many airport employers also provide free shuttle buses from nearby transit hubs to work sites on the airport campus. From most parts of Rexdale, the commute is approximately 15 to 30 minutes by bus. Be sure to check bus schedules against your shift times, especially for early morning starts when service frequency is lower.</p>

                        <p>Toronto Pearson operates 24/7, so most airport jobs involve shift work. Common shift patterns include early morning (4:00 AM to 12:00 PM), afternoon (12:00 PM to 8:00 PM), and overnight (8:00 PM to 4:00 AM). Many roles require weekend and statutory holiday availability, as these are peak travel periods. Some positions offer fixed schedules while others have rotating shifts. Part-time shifts of 4 to 6 hours are available in terminal retail, food service, and cleaning. Overnight and weekend shifts typically pay a premium of $1 to $3 more per hour.</p>

                        <p>Not all airport jobs require a driver's licence. Airline customer service agents, terminal cleaners, retail and food service workers, and security screening officers typically do not need one. However, ramp agent and baggage handler roles often require a valid Ontario G or G2 licence because the work involves operating ground support equipment such as tugs, belt loaders, and de-icing vehicles on the airfield. Cargo handler positions may also require a licence for forklift and vehicle operation. If you do not have a licence, there are still many positions available to you.</p>

                        <p>The typical hiring process involves several steps. First, apply online through the employer's career page or a job board like Indeed. If shortlisted, you attend an interview, often a group interview for high-volume roles. After receiving a conditional offer, you undergo a Transport Canada security background check (4 to 8 weeks), complete a RAIC application with fingerprinting and photo, attend security awareness training, and then receive job-specific training from your employer. The full process from application to first day can take 6 to 12 weeks. Staffing agencies sometimes help expedite parts of this timeline.</p>
