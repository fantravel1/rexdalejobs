Gig app drivers for Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Skip The Dishes typically earn $15-$25 per hour including tips, though income fluctuates based on time of day and demand. Amazon Flex drivers earn $18-$25/hr for scheduled delivery blocks. Employed courier drivers at companies like FedEx, UPS, and Purolator earn $20-$28/hr with benefits, pension contributions, and overtime pay. Long-haul AZ truck drivers operating out of Etobicoke can earn $24-$35/hr or more. Keep in mind that gig drivers must cover their own fuel, insurance, and vehicle maintenance costs, which reduces net earnings."

Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Skip The Dishes all accept drivers with a valid G2 licence, provided you meet their other requirements such as minimum age (usually 18 or 19), a clean driving record, and valid auto insurance. However, a G2 licence does come with restrictions — you cannot drive between midnight and 5:00 AM during your first six months, and you must maintain a zero blood alcohol level at all times. Some courier companies that hire employed drivers may prefer or require a full G licence, especially for roles that involve highway driving or operating larger vehicles."

You choose your own hours, use your own vehicle, and are paid per delivery or per block of time. There are no benefits, no guaranteed hours, and you are responsible for fuel, maintenance, insurance, and setting aside money for income taxes. A courier company job (FedEx, UPS, Purolator, or a local courier) means you are an employee. You typically work set shifts, may drive a company vehicle, and receive benefits such as health and dental coverage, paid vacation, and pension contributions. The trade-off is less flexibility — you follow a set schedule and assigned routes. For many drivers, starting with gig work to gain experience and then transitioning to an employed courier role offers the best of both worlds."

For gig app delivery (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Skip The Dishes), you generally need your own vehicle — but many platforms also allow deliveries by bicycle, e-bike, or scooter in Toronto, which is a great option if you do not own a car. Amazon Flex requires a mid-size or larger vehicle. For employed courier positions at FedEx, UPS, and Purolator, company vehicles are typically provided for the delivery route. Some smaller courier and logistics companies may require you to have your own car or van and will pay a vehicle allowance on top of your hourly wage. If you are considering using your own car, factor in the additional costs of commercial or ride-share insurance, fuel, and accelerated wear and tear."

For Uber Eats, download the Uber Driver app or visit drivers.uber.com, select delivery, and submit your documents: valid G or G2 licence (or just your ID if delivering by bike), vehicle registration and insurance (if driving), and a profile photo. Uber will run a background check which typically takes 5-10 business days. For DoorDash, visit dasher.doordash.com, enter your details, consent to a background check, and download the Dasher app. You will need a valid driver's licence, insurance, and a vehicle (car, scooter, or bicycle). Approval usually takes a few days. For Skip The Dishes, apply at couriers.skipthedishes.com with similar documentation. Once approved on any platform, you can start accepting deliveries immediately."

For food delivery apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash, you need at minimum standard auto insurance, but you should notify your insurer that you are using your vehicle for delivery purposes. Many standard personal auto policies exclude commercial use, and driving without proper coverage could void your policy in the event of a claim. Some Ontario insurers now offer ride-share or delivery endorsements at a reasonable cost. Uber provides supplemental commercial insurance while you are on an active delivery through their platform. For courier company jobs, the employer's commercial fleet insurance typically covers you while driving a company vehicle. If you use your own car for a courier company, you will need a commercial auto insurance policy, which costs more than personal insurance but is a legal and financial necessity."

                    "text": "Delivery driving can be a viable full-time job in Toronto, but the experience varies significantly between gig work and employed positions. Full-time gig delivery (Uber Eats, DoorDash) can generate $600-$1,200 per week in gross earnings, but after deducting fuel, insurance, vehicle depreciation, and taxes, net income is considerably lower. There are no benefits, no paid sick days, and income is unpredictable. Full-time employed courier positions at FedEx, UPS, or Purolator are generally a stronger option for career stability — they offer $40,000-$60,000+ annually with benefits, pension, paid vacation, and union protection in many cases. Many drivers use gig delivery as a stepping stone or supplement while pursuing a full G licence or AZ/DZ commercial licence, which opens doors to higher-paying long-haul trucking and dedicated fleet driver positions earning $60,000-$80,000+ per year."

                <!-- Overview -->
                <h2 id="overview-title">Toronto's Delivery &amp; Courier Job Market</h2>
                <p>The explosive growth of e-commerce and food delivery has transformed Toronto into one of Canada's busiest delivery markets. Online shopping surged during the pandemic and has stayed elevated — Canadians now spend over $60 billion annually on e-commerce, and a significant share of those packages move through the Greater Toronto Area. At the same time, food delivery apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Skip The Dishes have become a permanent fixture of urban life, creating thousands of flexible driving opportunities across the city.</p>
                <p>Rexdale and Etobicoke sit at a strategic crossroads for delivery work. The junction of <strong>Highways 401, 427, and 27</strong> provides direct access to every corner of the GTA, while proximity to <strong>Toronto Pearson International Airport</strong> means courier and logistics companies have concentrated their operations here. Amazon, FedEx, UPS, Purolator, and dozens of smaller courier firms all maintain distribution facilities within minutes of Rexdale, making the area a natural home base for delivery drivers.</p>
                <p>Delivery work in Toronto generally falls into three categories: <strong>gig/app-based delivery</strong> (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Skip The Dishes, Amazon Flex) where you work as an independent contractor with your own vehicle and set your own hours; <strong>courier company employment</strong> (FedEx, UPS, Purolator, local couriers) where you are a full-time or part-time employee with benefits and a set route; and <strong>corporate fleet driving</strong> (dedicated drivers for grocery chains, pharmaceutical distributors, or logistics companies) which often requires a DZ or AZ licence and offers the highest pay and stability.</p>

                <!-- Section: Gig vs Company -->
                <h2>Gig Delivery vs Company Driver: What's the Difference?</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest decisions for aspiring delivery drivers in Toronto is whether to pursue gig-based app delivery or seek employment with a courier company. Both paths have distinct advantages and trade-offs that are worth understanding before you commit.</p>
                <p><strong>Gig delivery (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Skip The Dishes, Amazon Flex)</strong> offers maximum flexibility. You log in when you want, work as many or as few hours as you choose, and are free to work for multiple platforms simultaneously. There is no interview process beyond a background check, and you can often start earning within a week of signing up. However, you are classified as an independent contractor, which means no employer-provided benefits, no paid sick days, and no vacation pay. You must use your own vehicle and cover all costs — fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation. At tax time, you are responsible for reporting your income and setting aside money for HST and income tax. After expenses, many gig drivers find their net hourly rate is lower than the gross figures suggest.</p>
                <p><strong>Company driver positions (FedEx, UPS, Purolator, local couriers)</strong> trade flexibility for stability. You work set shifts on assigned routes, often driving a company-provided vehicle. In return, you receive a guaranteed hourly wage, health and dental benefits, pension contributions, paid vacation, and often union representation. Your insurance and vehicle costs are covered by the employer. The hiring process is more involved — expect a formal interview, a driving abstract check, and potentially a road test — but the long-term earning potential and job security are significantly higher.</p>
                <p><strong>Insurance considerations</strong> are critical for gig drivers. Standard personal auto insurance in Ontario does not cover commercial delivery use. If you are in an accident while delivering and your insurer discovers you were working, your claim could be denied and your policy cancelled. Many Ontario insurers now offer delivery or ride-share endorsements at an additional cost, and some platforms like Uber provide supplemental coverage during active deliveries. Make sure you have proper coverage before you start.</p>
                <p><strong>Tax implications for gig workers</strong> are often overlooked. As an independent contractor, you must track all income and expenses, file an HST return if you earn over $30,000 annually, and make quarterly tax instalments. On the positive side, you can deduct a portion of vehicle expenses, phone bills, and other business costs. Keeping detailed records from day one will save you headaches at tax time.</p>

                <!-- Section: Requirements -->
                <h2>Requirements for Delivery Driver Jobs in Toronto</h2>
                <p>The qualifications you need depend on the type of delivery work you pursue, but here are the common requirements across most <strong>delivery driver jobs in Toronto</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>G Licence vs G2:</strong> Most delivery jobs accept a valid Ontario G2 licence, which is sufficient for food delivery apps and many courier positions. A full G licence is preferred or required for highway driving, long-distance routes, and most corporate fleet positions. For commercial truck driving, you will need an AZ (tractor-trailer) or DZ (straight truck) licence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean driving abstract:</strong> Employers and delivery platforms will request your Ontario driver's abstract, which shows your driving history, demerit points, and any suspensions. A clean record with no major convictions in the past three years is the standard expectation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Criminal record check:</strong> Most delivery companies and all gig platforms require a criminal background check. This is typically run through a third-party provider and takes 5-10 business days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle requirements:</strong> For gig delivery, you need a reliable vehicle in good condition — most platforms accept cars, and some accept bikes, e-bikes, or scooters for food delivery. Amazon Flex requires a mid-size sedan or larger. Company drivers typically use employer-provided vehicles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> If using your own vehicle, you need valid Ontario auto insurance with appropriate commercial or delivery endorsements. Proof of insurance is required by all platforms and employers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smartphone:</strong> All gig delivery platforms require a smartphone with GPS capability to receive orders, navigate routes, and confirm deliveries. A reliable phone mount and data plan are essential tools of the trade.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge of GTA roads:</strong> While GPS handles navigation, familiarity with Toronto's street grid, highway network, and neighbourhood layouts will make you faster and more efficient. Knowing shortcuts around Rexdale, Etobicoke, and the airport area is especially valuable for local courier work.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Section: AZ/DZ Licence -->
                <h2>Getting Your AZ/DZ Licence in Ontario</h2>
                <p>For drivers looking to move beyond app-based delivery into higher-paying commercial driving, obtaining an AZ or DZ licence opens significant career opportunities. Canada is facing a well-documented truck driver shortage, and licensed commercial drivers are in demand across Ontario.</p>
                <p><strong>Where to train near Rexdale:</strong> Several accredited truck driving schools operate in the Etobicoke, Mississauga, and Brampton area. Schools such as Humber College's truck driving program, Ontario Truck Driving School, and other Ministry-approved facilities offer both AZ and DZ training programs. Look for schools that are MELT (Mandatory Entry-Level Training) certified, as this is now a legal requirement in Ontario for all new commercial licence holders.</p>
                <p><strong>Cost of training:</strong> AZ licence training typically costs between $5,000 and $10,000 depending on the school and program length. DZ training is somewhat less expensive, ranging from $2,000 to $5,000. Some trucking companies offer sponsored training programs where they cover the cost of your licence in exchange for a commitment to work for them for a set period (usually one to two years).</p>
                <p><strong>MELT program requirements:</strong> Since July 2017, Ontario requires all new AZ licence applicants to complete a MELT program consisting of a minimum of 103.5 hours of training (36.5 hours in-class, 17 hours in-yard, and 50 hours in-cab). DZ MELT requires a minimum of 65 hours. You must complete MELT at an approved school before you can take your road test at a DriveTest centre.</p>
                <p><strong>Career path from delivery driver to long-haul:</strong> Many successful long-haul drivers started with local delivery work to build driving experience and comfort behind the wheel. A common career progression is: food delivery or courier work (G/G2 licence) to local DZ straight-truck driving (furniture delivery, construction materials, beverage distribution) to AZ long-haul or dedicated routes. Each step increases earning potential — experienced AZ drivers on long-haul or cross-border routes can earn $60,000 to $90,000+ annually with benefits, making it one of the most accessible high-paying careers that does not require a university degree.</p>

                            Delivery driver earnings in Toronto vary widely depending on the type of work. Gig app drivers for Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Skip The Dishes typically earn $15-$25 per hour including tips, though income fluctuates based on time of day and demand. Amazon Flex drivers earn $18-$25/hr for scheduled delivery blocks. Employed courier drivers at companies like FedEx, UPS, and Purolator earn $20-$28/hr with benefits, pension contributions, and overtime pay. Long-haul AZ truck drivers operating out of Etobicoke can earn $24-$35/hr or more. Keep in mind that gig drivers must cover their own fuel, insurance, and vehicle maintenance costs, which reduces net earnings.

                            Yes, you can do food delivery in Toronto with a G2 licence. Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Skip The Dishes all accept drivers with a valid G2 licence, provided you meet their other requirements such as minimum age (usually 18 or 19), a clean driving record, and valid auto insurance. However, a G2 licence does come with restrictions — you cannot drive between midnight and 5:00 AM during your first six months, and you must maintain a zero blood alcohol level at all times. Some courier companies that hire employed drivers may prefer or require a full G licence, especially for roles that involve highway driving or operating larger vehicles.

                            Gig delivery (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Skip The Dishes, Amazon Flex) means you work as an independent contractor. You choose your own hours, use your own vehicle, and are paid per delivery or per block of time. There are no benefits, no guaranteed hours, and you are responsible for fuel, maintenance, insurance, and setting aside money for income taxes. A courier company job (FedEx, UPS, Purolator, or a local courier) means you are an employee. You typically work set shifts, may drive a company vehicle, and receive benefits such as health and dental coverage, paid vacation, and pension contributions. The trade-off is less flexibility — you follow a set schedule and assigned routes. For many drivers, starting with gig work to gain experience and then transitioning to an employed courier role offers the best of both worlds.

                            It depends on the type of delivery job. For gig app delivery (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Skip The Dishes), you generally need your own vehicle — but many platforms also allow deliveries by bicycle, e-bike, or scooter in Toronto, which is a great option if you do not own a car. Amazon Flex requires a mid-size or larger vehicle. For employed courier positions at FedEx, UPS, and Purolator, company vehicles are typically provided for the delivery route. Some smaller courier and logistics companies may require you to have your own car or van and will pay a vehicle allowance on top of your hourly wage. If you are considering using your own car, factor in the additional costs of commercial or ride-share insurance, fuel, and accelerated wear and tear.

                            Signing up for Uber Eats or DoorDash in Toronto is straightforward and done entirely online. For Uber Eats, download the Uber Driver app or visit drivers.uber.com, select delivery, and submit your documents: valid G or G2 licence (or just your ID if delivering by bike), vehicle registration and insurance (if driving), and a profile photo. Uber will run a background check which typically takes 5-10 business days. For DoorDash, visit dasher.doordash.com, enter your details, consent to a background check, and download the Dasher app. You will need a valid driver's licence, insurance, and a vehicle (car, scooter, or bicycle). Approval usually takes a few days. For Skip The Dishes, apply at couriers.skipthedishes.com with similar documentation. Once approved on any platform, you can start accepting deliveries immediately.

                            Insurance requirements for delivery driving in Ontario depend on the type of delivery. For food delivery apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash, you need at minimum standard auto insurance, but you should notify your insurer that you are using your vehicle for delivery purposes. Many standard personal auto policies exclude commercial use, and driving without proper coverage could void your policy in the event of a claim. Some Ontario insurers now offer ride-share or delivery endorsements at a reasonable cost. Uber provides supplemental commercial insurance while you are on an active delivery through their platform. For courier company jobs, the employer's commercial fleet insurance typically covers you while driving a company vehicle. If you use your own car for a courier company, you will need a commercial auto insurance policy, which costs more than personal insurance but is a legal and financial necessity.

                            Delivery driving can be a viable full-time job in Toronto, but the experience varies significantly between gig work and employed positions. Full-time gig delivery (Uber Eats, DoorDash) can generate $600-$1,200 per week in gross earnings, but after deducting fuel, insurance, vehicle depreciation, and taxes, net income is considerably lower. There are no benefits, no paid sick days, and income is unpredictable. Full-time employed courier positions at FedEx, UPS, or Purolator are generally a stronger option for career stability — they offer $40,000-$60,000+ annually with benefits, pension, paid vacation, and often union protection. Many drivers use gig delivery as a stepping stone or supplement while pursuing a full G licence or AZ/DZ commercial licence, which opens doors to higher-paying long-haul trucking and dedicated fleet driver positions earning $60,000-$80,000+ per year.
