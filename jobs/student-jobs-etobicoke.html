Start by limiting work to 15-20 hours per week during the school year to protect your grades.

Look for employers who specifically advertise flexible scheduling for students. Use Humber's Career Centre to find on-campus positions that are designed around class schedules. Consider weekend-heavy shifts so your weekdays stay free for classes and studying. During exam periods, communicate early with your employer about needing reduced hours. Many students also take advantage of summer and holiday breaks to work full-time and save up."

                <ul>

                <h2>Summer Job Opportunities in Toronto</h2>
                <p>Summer is the best time for students to earn and save. With no classes to work around, you can take on full-time hours and gain the kind of sustained work experience that strengthens your resume. Here are the top <strong>summer job opportunities in Toronto</strong> for students:</p>

                <h3>Canada Summer Jobs (CSJ)</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Canada Summer Jobs program</strong> is a federal government initiative that provides wage subsidies to employers who create summer positions for youth aged 15 to 30. Positions span non-profits, small businesses, and the public sector across Toronto. Jobs are posted on the Government of Canada Job Bank website each spring, typically between January and March. Many community organizations in Rexdale and Etobicoke participate, offering roles in youth programming, administrative support, event coordination, and community outreach. These positions often pay above minimum wage because the government covers a significant portion of the salary.</p>

                <h3>City of Toronto Summer Positions</h3>
                <p>The City of Toronto hires hundreds of students each summer to work in parks, recreation centres, community programs, and municipal offices. Positions include camp counsellors, lifeguards, parks maintenance workers, and program assistants. Applications typically open in late winter, and positions near Rexdale can be found at Humber Summit, Thistletown, and West Humber community centres.</p>

                <h3>Seasonal and Tourism Jobs</h3>
                <p>Toronto's summer economy creates thousands of seasonal jobs. Popular options include amusement parks (Canada's Wonderland is accessible via GO Transit), golf courses in the Etobicoke area, landscaping and property maintenance companies, summer camps, and increased retail and food service hiring at malls and restaurants expecting tourist traffic.</p>

                <h2>Youth Employment Programs in the GTA</h2>
                <p>If you are a young person facing barriers to employment -- whether that is a lack of experience, limited job search skills, or other challenges -- there are <strong>government-funded youth programs in Toronto</strong> specifically designed to help you get started.</p>

                <h3>Youth Job Connection (YJC)</h3>
                <p>Funded by the Ontario government and delivered through Employment Ontario offices, <strong>Youth Job Connection</strong> serves youth aged 15 to 29 who face barriers to employment. The program provides paid pre-employment training (usually 2-4 weeks) covering workplace communication, resume writing, interview skills, and financial literacy. After training, participants are matched with local employers for paid job placements with ongoing coaching and mentoring. YJC also offers an education-focused stream for youth who want to return to school.</p>

                <h3>Ontario Youth Action Plan</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Ontario Youth Action Plan</strong> funds community organizations to deliver targeted programming for at-risk youth in priority neighbourhoods, including parts of Rexdale and North Etobicoke. Programs include skills training, job readiness workshops, mentorship, and direct employment opportunities. Local organizations like COSTI Immigrant Services, Rexdale Community Health Centre, and the Rexdale Community Hub deliver these programs.</p>

                <h3>Humber College Co-op and Work-Integrated Learning</h3>
                <p>Many programs at <strong>Humber College</strong> include mandatory co-op terms or field placements that give you structured, supervised work experience in your field of study. The Co-op and Work-Integrated Learning department maintains partnerships with hundreds of GTA employers. Even if your program does not include a mandatory co-op, Humber's Career Centre can connect you with internship and volunteer opportunities that build your professional network. The college also runs regular career fairs, employer information sessions, and networking events.</p>

                <h3>YMCA Employment Services</h3>
                <p>YMCA of Greater Toronto operates employment centres in Etobicoke offering free services for youth including career assessment, job search workshops, resume help, interview coaching, and connections to local employers. They also administer the federal Youth Employment and Skills Strategy (YESS) program, which provides wrap-around support for young people facing significant barriers to entering the workforce.</p>

                <h2>Balancing Work and School</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges for students is making money without tanking your grades. Here are practical strategies that work for students in the Rexdale and Humber College area:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cap your hours:</strong> During the academic year, aim for 15 to 20 hours per week maximum. Research consistently shows that working more than 20 hours during school can negatively affect academic performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose proximity:</strong> Work close to campus or along your commute route. A job at Woodbine Mall or on Rexdale Blvd saves you the hour-long round trip you would spend commuting to a downtown position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate early:</strong> Give your employer your class schedule at the start of each semester and flag exam periods in advance. Employers who regularly hire students expect this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider on-campus work:</strong> Humber's work-study positions are specifically designed around the academic calendar. You will never be scheduled during classes, and hours are reduced during exams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use breaks strategically:</strong> Save your full-time work for reading week, winter break, and summer. Many warehouse and logistics employers near Pearson ramp up hiring during the holiday season, which aligns perfectly with your school break.</li>
                    <li><strong>Take advantage of Humber resources:</strong> If work is affecting your academics, Humber's Student Success and Engagement team, the counselling centre, and peer tutoring services are all free and available to help you get back on track.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tips for Your First Job Application</h3>
                <p>If this is your first time applying for jobs, keep these tips in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Get your SIN:</strong> You need a Social Insurance Number before you can legally work in Canada. Apply at any Service Canada office; international students with a valid study permit are eligible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare a simple resume:</strong> Even without work experience, you can highlight academic achievements, volunteer work, relevant coursework, and transferable skills like teamwork and communication. Humber's Career Centre offers free resume reviews.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply in person for local jobs:</strong> For retail and food service positions along Rexdale Blvd and at Woodbine Mall, walking in with a printed resume and asking to speak with a manager is often more effective than applying online.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dress appropriately for interviews:</strong> Business casual is the standard for most student positions. Clean, neat clothing shows you take the opportunity seriously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> If you do not hear back within a week, a polite follow-up phone call or visit shows initiative and keeps your application top of mind.</li>
                </ul>

                            <p>Yes, most international students at designated learning institutions like Humber College can work part-time in Canada. With a valid study permit, you can work up to 24 hours per week during regular academic sessions and full-time during scheduled breaks such as winter and summer holidays. You will need a Social Insurance Number (SIN) from Service Canada before you can start working. On-campus jobs at Humber do not require a separate work permit. For co-op or internship positions that are part of your program, you will need a co-op work permit. Always verify your specific work authorization with Humber's International Centre.</p>

                            <p>Balancing work and school takes planning, but many Humber College students successfully manage both. Start by limiting work to 15-20 hours per week during the school year to protect your grades. Choose employers near campus or along your commute route to reduce travel time, as many businesses on Rexdale Boulevard and at Woodbine Mall are close to Humber North Campus. Look for employers who specifically advertise flexible scheduling for students. Use Humber's Career Centre to find on-campus positions that are designed around class schedules. Consider weekend-heavy shifts so your weekdays stay free for classes and studying. During exam periods, communicate early with your employer about needing reduced hours.</p>
