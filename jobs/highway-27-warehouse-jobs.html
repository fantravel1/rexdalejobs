                <!-- Section 1: The Highway 27 Industrial Corridor -->
                <h2 id="overview-title">The Highway 27 Industrial Corridor</h2>
                <p><strong>Highway 27</strong> runs north from Rexdale Boulevard to Steeles Avenue West, cutting through one of the most productive industrial zones in the Greater Toronto Area. Key intersections along this stretch — Belfield Road, Langstaff Road, Carrier Drive, and Ironside Drive — mark clusters of warehouses, distribution centres, and manufacturing facilities that employ thousands of workers year-round.</p>
                <p>The corridor is home to some of the biggest names in logistics and distribution. <strong>Amazon</strong> operates fulfillment centre operations in the area, while <strong>Purolator</strong> runs a major sort centre nearby. <strong>DHL</strong> and <strong>FedEx Ground</strong> maintain distribution terminals along Highway 27, handling parcels and freight destined for homes and businesses across southern Ontario. Food distribution giants like <strong>Sysco</strong> and <strong>Gordon Food Service</strong> operate large cold-chain warehouses serving restaurants, hotels, and institutions across the GTA. Pharmaceutical distributors, auto parts warehouses, and building materials suppliers round out the mix.</p>
                <p>So why has Highway 27 become Toronto's warehouse capital? Location is everything. The corridor offers direct access to <strong>Highway 401</strong> (Canada's busiest highway), <strong>Highway 427</strong>, and the <strong>407 ETR</strong>, enabling trucks to reach any point in southern Ontario within hours. <strong>Toronto Pearson International Airport</strong> sits just minutes to the south, making air cargo transfers seamless. CN and CP rail connections are also nearby, giving multi-modal logistics companies every transportation option they need. For job seekers, this density of employers means competition for workers is high — and that translates into better wages, shift premiums, and faster hiring timelines.</p>

                <!-- Section 3: Getting to Highway 27 by Transit -->
                <h2>Getting to Highway 27 by Transit</h2>
                <p>Reaching the <strong>Highway 27 industrial corridor</strong> by public transit is straightforward thanks to several TTC and MiWay routes that serve the area directly.</p>
                <p>The primary route is the <strong>TTC 191 Highway 27 Rocket</strong>, which runs from <strong>Kipling Station</strong> on the Bloor-Danforth subway line northbound along Highway 27. This express bus connects directly to the heart of the industrial zone and is the fastest transit option for workers commuting from downtown Toronto, Etobicoke, or anywhere along the subway line. The <strong>36 Finch West bus</strong> also crosses Highway 27, providing an east-west connection from <strong>Finch West Station</strong> on the new Line 6 and serving employers near the northern end of the corridor close to Steeles Avenue.</p>
                <p>For workers coming from <strong>Mississauga</strong>, several <strong>MiWay</strong> bus routes connect to the Highway 27 area, particularly useful for those living in the Malton or Rexdale-adjacent neighbourhoods. From the Rexdale Boulevard area, some warehouses on Highway 27 are within a <strong>15 to 20 minute walk</strong>, making it feasible for nearby residents to commute on foot or by bicycle using local trails and sidewalks.</p>
                <p>Many larger employers along Highway 27 also operate <strong>shuttle buses</strong> from nearby transit hubs, especially for afternoon and night-shift workers when regular bus service is less frequent. Ask about shuttle options during the application or interview process — they can make a significant difference for late-night commutes.</p>

                <p><strong>DHL Supply Chain</strong> operates distribution and contract logistics facilities in the area, serving retail and e-commerce clients. DHL hires warehouse associates, forklift operators, and inventory clerks. Known for structured training programs and internal promotion pathways.</p>
                <p><strong>FedEx Ground</strong> maintains a distribution terminal along the corridor for parcel sorting and last-mile delivery staging. Package handler and dock worker positions are available across all shifts. FedEx offers tuition reimbursement and benefits for part-time employees.</p>
                <p><strong>Sysco</strong> and <strong>Gordon Food Service</strong> operate large food distribution warehouses that supply restaurants, hospitals, and institutions across the GTA.

                <p>Most warehouses along Highway 27 run <strong>three shifts</strong>: day shift (6:00 AM - 2:00 PM), afternoon shift (2:00 PM - 10:00 PM), and night shift (10:00 PM - 6:00 AM).

                <!-- Section 5: Temp Agencies Near Highway 27 -->
                <h2>Temp Agencies Near Highway 27</h2>
                <p>Staffing agencies are the fastest route into a <strong>Highway 27 warehouse job</strong> for most workers, especially those new to the industry. Several major agencies maintain offices in the Rexdale and Etobicoke area and have longstanding relationships with employers along the corridor.</p>
                <p><strong>Randstad</strong> is one of the largest staffing firms operating in the area and places hundreds of workers into warehouse, logistics, and manufacturing roles every month. They offer walk-in registration at their local offices — bring two pieces of government-issued ID, your SIN, and a void cheque or direct deposit form. Randstad can often place you within 24-48 hours of registration.</p>
                <p><strong>Adecco</strong> specializes in warehouse and industrial placements across the GTA. They maintain close partnerships with many Highway 27 employers and frequently have same-week start dates available. Adecco also offers skills training and safety certifications to registered candidates at no cost.</p>
                <p><strong>Express Employment Professionals</strong> has a strong presence in Etobicoke and places workers into general labour, forklift, and shipping/receiving roles along the Highway 27 corridor. They are known for their temp-to-perm conversion program, which allows you to try out an employer before committing to a permanent position.</p>
                <p>The <strong>temp-to-perm</strong> process typically works like this: you start as a temporary agency worker at a warehouse. After a probation period of 3 to 6 months — during which you demonstrate reliability, a strong work ethic, and good attendance — the employer can offer you a permanent, full-time position directly on their payroll. At that point, you typically gain access to the company's full benefits package, higher pay rates, and vacation time. Many of the permanent warehouse employees along Highway 27 started their careers through this exact pathway.</p>
                <p>To register with a staffing agency, simply walk in during business hours (typically Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM). Bring valid government ID, your Social Insurance Number, proof of eligibility to work in Canada, and a basic resume. The registration process usually takes about an hour and includes a brief interview and orientation. Some agencies also conduct basic skills assessments and safety quizzes during registration.</p>
