During scheduled breaks such as winter holidays and summer vacation, you can work unlimited hours. On-campus jobs at Humber do not count toward the 20-hour limit.

The Highway 27 industrial corridor near Humber College is home to numerous logistics and distribution centres that offer Saturday and Sunday shifts specifically designed for workers with weekday commitments. Weekend warehouse shifts typically pay $18 to $23 per hour, often with shift premiums. Companies in the area hire order pickers, packers, and shipping associates for 8 to 12 hour weekend shifts. This is a popular option for Humber students because it keeps weekdays free for classes and studying while providing a solid paycheque. Check Indeed for weekend warehouse jobs near Rexdale or register with staffing agencies like Randstad and Adecco."

                <h2>Working While Studying at Humber College</h2>
                <p><strong>Humber College North Campus</strong> has a unique advantage that many other GTA campuses do not: it is surrounded by one of Etobicoke's most active employment corridors. The <strong>Highway 27 industrial zone</strong> to the west is packed with warehouses, logistics centres, and manufacturing operations. <strong>Woodbine Mall</strong> to the south offers dozens of retail and food service employers. And the <strong>Rexdale Boulevard commercial strip</strong> running east-west is lined with restaurants, banks, grocery stores, and small businesses that are always looking for reliable part-time help.</p>
                <p>Getting to these jobs is straightforward. <strong>TTC Route 36 Finch West</strong> connects you east along Finch Avenue. <strong>Route 96 Wilson</strong> runs south to Wilson Station on the Yonge-University subway line. <strong>Route 106 Sentinel</strong> connects you to Finch West Station on the new Line 6. And <strong>Route 191 Highway 27 Rocket</strong> runs the length of Highway 27, linking you directly to the warehouse and industrial district as well as Humber Bay. Most of these buses stop right at or near Humber's campus entrance.</p>
                <p>Balancing work and school is the biggest challenge for student workers. Academic advisors at Humber recommend keeping work to <strong>15 to 20 hours per week</strong> during the school year. Choose employers close to campus so you are not losing hours to commuting. Communicate your class schedule to your manager at the start of every semester, and flag exam periods early. Many employers along Rexdale Blvd and at Woodbine Mall are accustomed to hiring students and will work with your availability.</p>
                <p>If you are an <strong>international student</strong>, your study permit allows you to work up to <strong>20 hours per week</strong> during regular academic sessions and <strong>unlimited hours during scheduled breaks</strong> (winter holidays, summer). You will need a <strong>Social Insurance Number (SIN)</strong> from Service Canada before you can start any paid work. Humber's International Centre and Career Services office can walk you through the process and connect you with their internal job board, which lists positions from employers who are specifically looking to hire Humber students.</p>

                <h3>Study Permit Work Authorization</h3>
                <p>Your study permit must include a condition that says you are authorized to work off campus. Most study permits issued for full-time students at designated learning institutions like Humber include this automatically. If yours does not, contact Humber's International Centre or IRCC to have it added before accepting any off-campus work.</p>

                <h3>Getting Your SIN Number</h3>
                <p>You cannot legally work in Canada without a <strong>Social Insurance Number (SIN)</strong>. Apply at any Service Canada office; bring your passport, study permit, and a letter of enrolment from Humber. The closest Service Canada location to campus is at 2291 Kipling Avenue. Processing is typically same-day. Do this as early as possible, ideally during your first week in Canada.</p>

                <h3>The 20-Hour Rule</h3>
                <p>During regular academic sessions, international students are limited to <strong>20 hours of work per week</strong> off campus. On-campus employment at Humber does not count toward this cap. During scheduled breaks (winter holidays, summer vacation, reading week if it falls between semesters), you can work <strong>unlimited hours</strong>. Keep careful track of your hours each week. Exceeding the 20-hour limit can jeopardize your study permit and your ability to stay in Canada.</p>

                <h3>How to Track Your Hours</h3>
                <p>Keep a simple spreadsheet or use an app to log your weekly hours from all off-campus jobs combined. If you work for multiple employers, the 20-hour limit applies to the total, not per employer. Ask each employer for a copy of your time sheets and keep your pay stubs organized. This documentation protects you if your work authorization is ever questioned.</p>

                <h3>Tax Filing Requirements</h3>
                <p>Even as an international student, you are required to file a Canadian income tax return if you earned any income during the year. The tax year runs from January 1 to December 31, and the filing deadline is April 30. You will receive T4 slips from each employer by the end of February. Many students qualify for tax refunds, and filing also lets you claim the GST/HST credit and tuition tax credits. Humber's tax clinic and the Canada Revenue Agency's free Community Volunteer Income Tax Program can help you file for free.</p>

                <h2>Humber College Programs That Lead to Jobs</h2>
                <p>One of Humber's strengths is its focus on career-ready education. Several programs are specifically designed to move you directly into employment upon graduation, and many include co-op or field placement components that give you a head start.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Support Worker (PSW) Certificate</strong> -- This accelerated program prepares you for healthcare support roles in long-term care homes, hospitals, and home care agencies. PSW jobs are in extremely high demand across the GTA, with starting wages of $19 to $24 per hour. Field placements are built into the program.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skilled Trades Programs</strong> -- Humber's apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and carpentry lead to licensed trade careers. Construction is booming in the GTA, and journeyperson wages can exceed $40 per hour. Co-op terms are included.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hospitality and Tourism Management</strong> -- Prepares you for management roles in restaurants, hotels, event venues, and tourism operations. The program includes a mandatory field placement, and many students are hired by their placement employers. Rexdale's proximity to Pearson Airport makes this especially relevant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Technology Programs</strong> -- Humber's IT, cybersecurity, and web development programs lead to careers that often allow remote work. Many graduates find positions before completing their co-op term. Starting salaries for IT roles in the GTA range from $45,000 to $65,000 per year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <strong>co-op advantage</strong> cannot be overstated. Students who complete co-op placements are significantly more likely to receive a job offer within six months of graduation. Humber's co-op office maintains relationships with hundreds of employers specifically looking to hire Humber graduates.</p>

                            <p>For domestic students, there is no legal limit on how many hours you can work, but Humber's academic advisors recommend capping work at 15 to 20 hours per week during the school year to protect your grades. For international students, the legal limit is 20 hours per week during regular academic sessions, with unlimited hours permitted during scheduled breaks between semesters. On-campus employment at Humber does not count toward the 20-hour weekly cap for international students. During co-op or work placement terms, you may work full-time as part of your academic program with a valid co-op work permit.</p>

                            <p>Yes, many Humber College programs include mandatory co-op or work-integrated learning components. Programs in business, technology, health sciences, hospitality, and skilled trades all have co-op streams that place students with employers across the GTA for paid work terms. Humber's Co-op and Work-Integrated Learning department maintains partnerships with hundreds of employers. Even if your program does not have a mandatory co-op, you may be able to add a co-op term or find internship opportunities through the Career Centre. Co-op students gain career-relevant experience, earn academic credit, and often receive job offers from their placement employers after graduation.</p>

                            <p>Absolutely. The Highway 27 industrial corridor near Humber College is home to numerous logistics and distribution centres that offer Saturday and Sunday shifts specifically designed for workers with weekday commitments. Weekend warehouse shifts typically pay $18 to $23 per hour, often with shift premiums. Companies in the area hire order pickers, packers, and shipping associates for 8 to 12 hour weekend shifts. This is a popular option for Humber students because it keeps weekdays free for classes and studying while providing a solid paycheque.
