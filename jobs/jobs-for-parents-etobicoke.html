The subsidy is income-based, so working part-time may actually make it easier to qualify since your household income will be lower. The City of Toronto administers the subsidy program and considers your total family income, the number of children needing care, and the type of care you use. You can receive a full or partial subsidy for licensed child care centres, licensed home child care, and some before-and-after school programs. To apply, contact Toronto Children's Services or visit a local EarlyON Child and Family Centre in Rexdale for help with the application. Wait times can be significant, so apply as early as possible."

Be honest and brief: a single line such as 'Career break for family caregiving' in your work history is sufficient. Focus your resume on skills rather than strict chronology by using a functional or combination resume format that highlights what you can do. Emphasize any activities during your break that demonstrate professional skills, such as volunteering at your children's school, managing a household budget, coordinating schedules, or taking online courses. Many employers in Etobicoke and Toronto are understanding of career gaps, especially for parenting. During interviews, frame your return positively by expressing your enthusiasm and readiness to re-enter the workforce. Employment Ontario offices in Rexdale offer free resume workshops specifically designed for people returning to work after a break."

                <h2>Finding Work That Fits Your Family Schedule</h2>
                <p>Balancing work and childcare is one of the biggest challenges parents face, especially when you are doing it on your own or without extended family nearby to help. The good news is that <strong>Rexdale, Etobicoke, and the broader Toronto area</strong> offer a growing number of flexible work arrangements that let you earn an income without sacrificing the time your children need you most.</p>
                <p>The types of flexible arrangements available in the area include <strong>school-hours shifts</strong> (typically 9am to 3pm), split shifts that let you do drop-off and pickup, part-time positions with 15 to 25 hours per week, remote and work-from-home roles where you set your own schedule, and evening or weekend positions for families where another caregiver is available during those times.</p>
                <p>Ontario's <strong>Child Care Subsidy program</strong> can significantly reduce the cost of licensed daycare and before-and-after school programs, making it financially worthwhile to take even a part-time position. Many parents find that the combination of a subsidy and a flexible job actually puts them ahead financially compared to staying home full-time. Before-and-after school programs at local elementary schools, including those run by the TDSB and community organizations, can extend your available work hours from as early as 7am to as late as 6pm, giving you a much wider window to schedule shifts.</p>

                <h2>Childcare Resources in Rexdale & Etobicoke</h2>
                <p>Affordable, reliable childcare is the foundation that makes working possible for most parents. Here are the key <strong>childcare resources available in the Rexdale and Etobicoke area</strong>:</p>

                <h3>Ontario Child Care Subsidy</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Ontario Child Care Subsidy</strong>, administered by the City of Toronto, helps eligible families pay for licensed child care based on household income and family size. The subsidy can cover full or partial costs at licensed child care centres, licensed home child care providers, and before-and-after school programs. Families with lower incomes may receive a full subsidy, meaning zero out-of-pocket costs for child care. To apply, you can visit the City of Toronto's Children's Services website or get in-person help at a local EarlyON centre.</p>

                <h3>Rexdale Community Daycare Options</h3>
                <p>Rexdale and North Etobicoke have several licensed daycare centres and home child care agencies serving families with infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children. Centres connected to community organizations like the <strong>Rexdale Community Hub</strong> and the <strong>Rexdale Community Health Centre</strong> often have relationships with subsidy programs and can help you navigate the application process. Licensed home child care agencies match families with screened providers in residential homes, which can offer more flexible hours than centre-based care.</p>

                <h3>Before-and-After School Programs</h3>
                <p>Most elementary schools in the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) and Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) in the Rexdale area offer before-and-after school programs for children aged 4 to 12. These programs typically run from 7am to the start of school and from school dismissal until 6pm, giving parents a full workday window. Many of these programs are subsidy-eligible. Community centres in the area also run after-school programs with activities, homework help, and recreational programming.</p>

                <h3>EarlyON Child and Family Centres</h3>
                <p><strong>EarlyON Child and Family Centres</strong> in Rexdale offer free drop-in programs for parents and children from birth to age six. While not a substitute for full-time childcare, EarlyON centres provide a valuable resource for parents who are job searching, working part-time, or transitioning back to work. Staff can also connect you with local childcare options, subsidy information, and other family support services.</p>

                <h3>Subsidy Waitlists and How to Apply</h3>
                <p>Be aware that the <strong>child care subsidy waitlist in Toronto</strong> can be long, sometimes several months or more. Apply as soon as possible, even before you have secured a job, as having subsidy approval in place makes it easier to accept a position when one becomes available. You can apply through the City of Toronto's centralized online system or visit a local service office. Having your income documentation, identification, and proof of address ready will speed up the process. If you are receiving Ontario Works or Ontario Disability Support Program benefits, you may qualify for priority placement on the waitlist.</p>

                <h2>Returning to Work After a Career Break</h2>
                <p>Whether you stepped away from work for one year or ten, returning to the workforce as a parent is both exciting and daunting. Here is how to approach it confidently:</p>

                <h3>Refreshing Your Resume</h3>
                <p>Start by updating your resume to reflect your current skills and any activities you have undertaken during your break. Include any <strong>volunteer work, courses, certifications, or community involvement</strong> from your time away. Use a functional or combination resume format that leads with your skills and qualifications rather than a strict chronological work history. Free resume help is available at Employment Ontario offices in Etobicoke and at community organizations like COSTI Immigrant Services.</p>

                <h3>Explaining Career Gaps Positively</h3>
                <p>A career gap for parenting is completely normal, and most employers understand this. Keep your explanation brief and positive: "I took time to care for my young children and am now ready and eager to return to work." Focus the conversation on what you bring to the role, not on the time you were away. Many employers in Rexdale and Etobicoke actively value the reliability, time management, and multitasking abilities that parents develop.</p>

                <h3>Skills Transfer from Parenting to the Workplace</h3>
                <p>Parenting builds real, transferable workplace skills that employers value. <strong>Time management, budgeting, conflict resolution, patience, multitasking, scheduling, and problem-solving</strong> are all competencies that translate directly into most jobs. If you organized school events, managed a household budget, coordinated multiple schedules, or navigated complex systems like school enrolment or medical appointments, you have been building skills that employers need.</p>

                <h3>Volunteer Opportunities That Build Experience</h3>
                <p>If you have been out of the workforce for a while and want to build recent experience before applying for paid positions, volunteering is an excellent strategy. Volunteer at your children's school, local community centres, food banks, or places of worship. These roles provide current references, demonstrate initiative, and help you rebuild professional confidence. Many volunteer roles in Rexdale lead directly to paid positions when organizations see your work ethic and reliability.</p>

                <h3>Ontario Works Employment Supports</h3>
                <p>If you are receiving <strong>Ontario Works (OW)</strong> benefits, your caseworker can connect you with employment supports including job search assistance, skills training, resume preparation, interview coaching, and in some cases, funding for work-related expenses like transportation and clothing.

                <h2>Evening & Weekend Options for Two-Parent Families</h2>
                <p>For families with two parents or a second caregiver available, a <strong>split-shift strategy</strong> can maximize household income while ensuring someone is always home with the children. Here is how many families in Rexdale and Etobicoke make it work:</p>

                <h3>The Split-Shift Strategy</h3>
                <p>One parent works a daytime job while the other handles childcare, then they swap in the evening. This approach eliminates or greatly reduces childcare costs and ensures your children always have a parent present. It requires strong communication and planning between partners, but many families find it financially and personally rewarding. Common pairings include one parent working a 7am to 3pm shift and the other working 4pm to midnight.</p>

                <h3>Night Shift and Evening Jobs That Pay More</h3>
                <p><strong>Night shift warehouse, security, and cleaning jobs</strong> in Etobicoke frequently pay shift premiums of $1 to $3 per hour above the base rate. Warehouse positions near Pearson Airport run overnight shifts from 10pm to 6am paying $18 to $21 per hour. Security guard positions at commercial and residential properties offer overnight shifts at $17 to $20 per hour. Commercial cleaning crews working from 6pm to midnight earn $17 to $19 per hour. These premium-paying shifts can make the split-shift arrangement even more financially attractive.</p>

                <h3>Weekend-Only Positions</h3>
                <p>Some employers in Etobicoke offer <strong>weekend-only schedules</strong> that let you work Saturday and Sunday while your partner or family handles childcare. Retail stores at Woodbine Mall, restaurants along Rexdale Boulevard, and warehouse operations near the airport all have weekend-focused positions. Some weekend-only roles offer slightly higher pay or compressed schedules, such as two 12-hour shifts that give you a full 24-hour paycheque in just two days.</p>

                            <p>Yes, you can work part-time and still qualify for the Ontario Child Care Subsidy. The subsidy is income-based, so working part-time may actually make it easier to qualify since your household income will be lower. The City of Toronto administers the subsidy program and considers your total family income, the number of children needing care, and the type of care you use. You can receive a full or partial subsidy for licensed child care centres, licensed home child care, and some before-and-after school programs. To apply, contact Toronto Children's Services or visit a local EarlyON Child and Family Centre in Rexdale for help with the application. Wait times can be significant, so apply as early as possible.</p>

                            <p>Explaining a career gap on your resume is simpler than most parents think. Be honest and brief: a single line such as "Career break for family caregiving" in your work history is sufficient. Focus your resume on skills rather than strict chronology by using a functional or combination resume format that highlights what you can do. Emphasize any activities during your break that demonstrate professional skills, such as volunteering at your children's school, managing a household budget, coordinating schedules, or taking online courses. Many employers in Etobicoke and Toronto are understanding of career gaps, especially for parenting. During interviews, frame your return positively by expressing your enthusiasm and readiness to re-enter the workforce. Employment Ontario offices in Rexdale offer free resume workshops specifically designed for people returning to work after a break.</p>
