                <!-- How Temp Agencies Work -->
                <h2 id="overview-title">How Temp Agencies Work</h2>
                <p>If you have never used a temp agency before, the process is simpler than you might think. A <strong>temp agency in Etobicoke</strong> (also called a staffing agency or temporary help agency) acts as a middleman between you and employers who need workers. You do not apply to the employer directly — instead, you register with the agency, and they match you to available positions based on your skills, availability, and location.</p>
                <p>Here is how the process works step by step: First, you visit the agency office in person. You bring two pieces of government-issued ID, your Social Insurance Number, and ideally CSA-approved safety boots if you want warehouse or factory work. You fill out an application, provide your availability, and may complete a brief orientation or safety training. The agency then adds you to their roster. When a client company needs workers — often the same day or next day — the agency calls or texts you with the assignment details: where to go, what time to arrive, what the job involves, and how much it pays.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest advantages of temp work is that the agency handles all payroll. They deduct your taxes, CPP, and EI, and issue your T4 at tax time. You get paid by the agency on a regular schedule — weekly is most common, though some agencies offer daily pay. You are technically employed by the agency, even though you work at the client company's location.</p>
                <p>Temp work also lets you try different workplaces and industries without committing to one employer. If you do not like an assignment, you can ask for a different one. If you perform well at a workplace, many employers will offer to hire you permanently — this is the <strong>temp-to-perm pathway</strong> that thousands of workers in the GTA use to land full-time jobs with benefits.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros of temp work:</strong> Fast access to employment, no long application process, ability to try different workplaces, flexibility in scheduling, path to permanent employment, no cost to workers.</p>
                <p><strong>Cons of temp work:</strong> Pay may be slightly lower than direct-hire positions, hours are not always guaranteed, assignments can end with short notice, benefits are typically not included during the temp period.</p>

Adecco also runs a strong temp-to-perm program and provides free online skills training to registered workers.</p>
                <p><strong>Express Employment Professionals</strong> operates several franchise offices in the GTA and focuses on light industrial, warehouse, and skilled trades placements.

                <!-- What to Bring to a Temp Agency -->
                <h2>What to Bring to a Temp Agency</h2>
                <p>Being prepared when you walk into a temp agency makes the difference between starting work today and having to come back tomorrow. Here is a detailed checklist of everything you should bring when registering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Two pieces of government-issued photo ID.</strong> Accepted forms include a valid driver's licence, Ontario Photo Card, Canadian passport, permanent resident card, or citizenship card. At least one must have your photo. Having two forms of ID ready speeds up the registration process significantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Insurance Number (SIN).</strong> Bring your SIN card if you have one, or have the nine-digit number memorized. The agency needs your SIN to process payroll, tax deductions, and issue your T4. If you have lost your SIN card, you can request a confirmation letter from Service Canada.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSA-approved safety boots.</strong> For warehouse, factory, and construction temp positions, you will need steel-toed or composite-toed boots with the green triangle CSA certification symbol. You can purchase safety boots at Mark's Work Wearhouse, Walmart, or Canadian Tire for $60-$120. Some agencies will not send you to industrial jobs without proper footwear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Banking information for direct deposit.</strong> Bring a void cheque or a direct deposit form from your bank. Most temp agencies pay via direct deposit on a weekly basis. Some agencies also offer pay cards or daily pay options if you do not have a bank account.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resume (optional but helpful).</strong> While a resume is not required for most general labour and warehouse temp positions, having one can help the agency match you with higher-paying or more desirable assignments. Even a simple one-page resume listing your work history and availability is useful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work permit (if applicable).</strong> If you are not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, bring your valid work permit. The agency will need to verify that you are legally authorized to work in Canada. Open work permits and co-op work permits are both accepted at most agencies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What to wear:</strong> Dress in clean, practical clothing. For industrial placements, wear long pants (jeans or work pants), a t-shirt or long-sleeve shirt, and bring your safety boots. Avoid shorts, sandals, or clothing with offensive graphics. For office temp roles, dress in business casual attire.</p>
                <p><strong>What to expect during orientation:</strong> Most agencies will have you fill out paperwork (application form, tax forms, direct deposit authorization), complete a brief safety orientation or WHMIS training video, and may ask about your skills, availability, and shift preferences. The entire process takes 30 minutes to an hour. Some agencies conduct the orientation on the spot, while others schedule it for the following day.</p>

                <!-- Temp-to-Permanent -->
                <h2>Temp-to-Permanent: Turning Temp Work Into a Full-Time Job</h2>
                <p>One of the most valuable aspects of temp work is the <strong>temp-to-perm pathway</strong>. Many employers in Etobicoke and across the GTA use temp agencies as a way to evaluate potential employees before making a permanent hire. For you, this means a temp assignment is essentially a working interview — an opportunity to prove yourself and land a full-time job with benefits, paid time off, and job security.</p>
                <p>The typical conversion timeline is <strong>60 to 90 days</strong>. During this period, the employer evaluates your attendance, work quality, attitude, and how well you fit with the team. If they are satisfied, they will offer to bring you on as a direct employee. At that point, the agency's involvement ends, and you become a regular employee of the company with all the associated benefits.</p>
                <p>Employers use the temp-to-perm model for several practical reasons: it reduces their hiring risk, allows them to assess workers in a real work environment rather than just an interview, and provides flexibility during busy periods. For workers, the benefits are clear — you get your foot in the door at companies that might otherwise require extensive applications and interviews.</p>
                <p><strong>Your rights under Ontario's Employment Standards Act (ESA)</strong> protect you during the temp period. You are entitled to the same minimum wage, overtime pay, public holiday pay, and vacation pay as any other worker. When you convert to a permanent employee, your tenure with the temp agency may count toward your probationary period with the employer, depending on the company's policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Tips for getting converted from temp to permanent:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show up on time, every time.</strong> Attendance is the number one factor employers consider when evaluating temp workers for permanent hire. Arriving early and never calling in sick (unless genuinely ill) makes you stand out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demonstrate a positive attitude.</strong> Be friendly, cooperative, and willing to take on tasks outside your normal duties. Employers notice workers who go the extra mile without being asked.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn the operation.</strong> Pay attention to how the business runs. Learn names, understand procedures, and show interest in how your role fits into the bigger picture. Workers who show initiative and curiosity are far more likely to be kept on permanently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate with your agency.</strong> Let your temp agency know that you are interested in a permanent position. They can advocate on your behalf with the employer and help facilitate the conversion process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask about the timeline.</strong> Do not be afraid to ask the employer directly about the possibility of permanent hire. This shows ambition and gives you clarity on where you stand.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Your Rights as a Temp Worker in Ontario -->
                <h2>Your Rights as a Temp Worker in Ontario</h2>
                <p>Temp workers in Ontario are fully protected under the <strong>Employment Standards Act (ESA)</strong>. Understanding your rights ensures you are treated fairly and can advocate for yourself if issues arise. Here is what every temp worker should know:</p>
                <p><strong>Equal pay provisions:</strong> Under Ontario's ESA, temp agency workers who have been assigned to the same client employer for a certain period may be entitled to the same rate of pay as comparable employees hired directly by the client. This provision is designed to prevent employers from using temp agencies to pay workers less for the same work.</p>
                <p><strong>Workplace safety rights:</strong> You have the right to a safe workplace, regardless of whether you are a temp worker or permanent employee. Your temp agency and the client employer share the responsibility of keeping you safe. You have the right to know about hazards in the workplace, the right to participate in health and safety committees, and the <strong>right to refuse unsafe work</strong> without fear of reprisal.</p>
                <p><strong>Holiday pay:</strong> Temp workers are entitled to public holiday pay for Ontario's nine statutory holidays. If you are required to work on a public holiday, you are entitled to premium pay (time and a half) plus a substitute day off, or your regular pay plus premium pay for the hours worked, depending on the arrangement.</p>
                <p><strong>Vacation pay:</strong> Temp agencies must pay you vacation pay of at least 4% of your gross earnings. This is often included in your regular pay (shown as a line item on your pay stub) or paid out when your assignment ends.</p>
                <p><strong>Termination notice:</strong> If a temp agency terminates your employment (as opposed to simply ending an assignment), you may be entitled to written notice or termination pay, depending on how long you have been employed by the agency. The notice period ranges from one week (after three months of employment) to eight weeks (after eight or more years).</p>
                <p><strong>No fees:</strong> It is illegal for temp agencies to charge you any fees for finding you work, preparing your resume, or providing any other employment-related services. All agency costs are paid by the employer.</p>
                <p><strong>Who to contact if issues arise:</strong> If you believe your rights as a temp worker are being violated, you can file a complaint with the <strong>Ontario Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development</strong>. You can call their Employment Standards Information Centre at 1-800-531-5551 or file a claim online. You have up to two years from the date of the alleged violation to file a complaint.</p>

                            Temp agencies act as a middleman between you and employers. You register with the agency by visiting their office with two pieces of government-issued ID and your SIN. The agency then matches you to available positions based on your skills and availability. You work at the employer's location, but the agency handles your payroll, deductions, and T4. Most temp agencies in Etobicoke specialize in warehouse, factory, and general labour placements and can place you the same day or next day you register.

                            Yes, many temp agencies in Etobicoke and Toronto offer same-day start positions. To maximize your chances, arrive at the agency early in the morning (between 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM) with all required documents — two pieces of government ID, your SIN, and CSA-approved safety boots if you are available for warehouse or factory work. Same-day placements are most common for general labour, warehouse, and factory positions. Some agencies also offer next-day starts if you register in the afternoon.

                            No. In Ontario, it is illegal for temp agencies to charge workers a fee for finding them employment. The agency earns its money from the employer, not from you. Under the Ontario Employment Standards Act, temporary help agencies cannot charge workers for assigning them work, providing them with assistance in preparing resumes, or helping them find employment. If any agency asks you to pay a fee, this is a red flag and you should report it to the Ontario Ministry of Labour.

Typically, you work as a temp for 60 to 90 days while the employer evaluates your performance, attendance, and fit with their team. If both sides are happy, the employer hires you directly as a permanent employee, often with better pay, benefits, and job security.
