Many employers in Toronto, including Tim Hortons, McDonald's, and grocery stores like FreshCo and Metro, hire workers starting at age 14 or 15 for limited roles such as cashier, bagger, or dining room attendant."

Many of these opportunities are available in Rexdale and Etobicoke, especially along Rexdale Boulevard and at Woodbine Mall."

If you earn tips (for example, working at a restaurant), your employer cannot pay you less than minimum wage and count tips toward making up the difference. The only exception is the student minimum wage of $15.60 per hour, which applies only to students under 18 who work 28 hours or fewer per week during the school year, or work during a school break or summer holiday."

However, the Education Act requires that students under 16 attend school, which effectively limits work to after school hours, evenings, and weekends during the school year. Most employers hiring 14 and 15-year-olds will schedule shifts of 3 to 4 hours on school days (typically after 3:30 PM) and up to 8 hours on weekends and holidays. A reasonable guideline is 10 to 15 hours per week during the school year to ensure your grades do not suffer. During summer break and school holidays, 15-year-olds can work longer hours, similar to adult schedules."

You also do not legally need your parents' written consent to get a job, although many employers will ask for parental permission as part of their own hiring policy, especially for workers under 16. What you do need before starting any job is a Social Insurance Number (SIN), which you can apply for at any Service Canada office with your birth certificate or other proof of identity. If you are an international student or newcomer, different rules may apply depending on your immigration status."

Under Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Act, workers must be at least 15 to work in a factory setting, and many warehouse operations fall under factory regulations. At 16, you are legally permitted to work in a warehouse but you cannot operate forklifts, powered industrial trucks, or other heavy machinery until you are 18 in most cases. Typical warehouse roles available to 16-year-olds include order picking, packing, sorting, and light shipping tasks. Many warehouses and distribution centres near Pearson Airport and along the Highway 27 corridor in Etobicoke do hire 16 and 17-year-olds for these roles, often paying $17-$20 per hour with shift premiums for evenings and weekends."

                <h2>Ontario Laws for Teen Workers</h2>
                <p>Before you start applying for jobs, it is important to understand the <strong>Ontario laws that apply to teen workers</strong>. The rules come from two main pieces of legislation: the Employment Standards Act (ESA) and the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA). These laws exist to protect young workers while still allowing teenagers to gain valuable work experience.</p>

                <h3>Ages 14-15: What You Can and Cannot Do</h3>
                <p>If you are <strong>14 or 15 years old</strong>, you can legally work in Ontario in most office, retail, and food service settings. You can work as a cashier, stock shelves, clean dining rooms, serve food, and perform general customer service tasks. However, there are important restrictions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No factory or industrial work:</strong> You cannot work in a factory, manufacturing plant, or industrial setting until you are at least 15.</li>
                    <li><strong>No construction or mining:</strong> These industries are off-limits until at least 16 (construction) or 18 (underground mining).</li>
                    <li><strong>No hazardous kitchen tasks:</strong> While you can work in a restaurant, you generally cannot operate deep fryers, industrial slicers, or other dangerous kitchen equipment at 14-15.</li>
                    <li><strong>School attendance is mandatory:</strong> Under the Ontario Education Act, you must attend school until age 18. This means you cannot work during school hours on school days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximum hours during the school year:</strong> While the ESA does not set a hard weekly cap for 14-15-year-olds, your hours are effectively limited by mandatory school attendance. Most employers will schedule you for 10-15 hours per week during the school year, typically after-school shifts and weekends.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ages 16-17: Fewer Restrictions, More Opportunities</h3>
                <p>At <strong>16 and 17</strong>, many more job types become available. You can work in construction, warehouses, and a wider range of food service roles. However, some restrictions remain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No operating heavy machinery:</strong> Forklifts, powered industrial trucks, and certain factory equipment are generally restricted to workers 18 and older.</li>
                    <li><strong>No working at heights without supervision:</strong> Roofing and certain elevated construction tasks have additional age requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Night shifts for under 16:</strong> While there is no blanket provincial ban on night work for teens, many employers have internal policies against scheduling workers under 16 for late-night or overnight shifts. The requirement to attend school the next day also makes night work impractical for younger teens.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Parental Consent</h3>
                <p><strong>Parental consent is not legally required</strong> in Ontario for a teenager to get a job. There is no provincial law that says your parents must sign a form before you can work. However, many employers -- especially fast food chains and large retailers -- will ask for a parent or guardian's signature as part of their own company policy, particularly if you are under 16. It is a good idea to have your parents on board regardless, as they can help you navigate your first work experience.</p>

                <h2>How to Get Your First Job With No Experience</h2>
                <p>Landing your <strong>first job as a teenager</strong> can feel intimidating when you have no work history to put on a resume. The good news is that every employer hiring teens knows you are starting from zero. Here is how to stand out anyway:</p>

                <h3>Create a Simple Resume (Even With No Work History)</h3>
                <p>You do not need years of experience to write a resume. Focus on what you do have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Your name, phone number, and email address. Use a professional-sounding email, not a joke or gaming handle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Your school name, grade level, and expected graduation year. Mention any relevant courses like business, tech, or food and nutrition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Volunteer work:</strong> Any community service, church or mosque volunteering, school clubs, or sports teams. These show you can commit to responsibilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> List practical skills like communication, teamwork, basic math, computer skills, bilingual abilities, or any certifications like Food Handler's or babysitting courses.</li>
                    <li><strong>References:</strong> A teacher, coach, or community leader who can vouch for your character and reliability. Always ask permission before listing someone as a reference.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Practice a 30-Second Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p>When you walk into a business or meet a hiring manager, you need a quick introduction ready. Something like: "Hi, my name is [Name], I am a Grade 10 student at [School], and I am looking for a part-time position after school and on weekends. I am reliable, a quick learner, and I am excited to get my first work experience." Practice this until it sounds natural, not rehearsed.</p>

                <h3>Apply in Person at Local Businesses</h3>
                <p>For retail and food service jobs in Rexdale and Etobicoke, walking in with a printed resume is often more effective than applying online. Visit during non-peak hours (mid-morning on weekdays is ideal), ask politely to speak with the manager, introduce yourself with your elevator pitch, and hand them your resume. Dress neatly -- you do not need a suit, but clean clothes and a friendly attitude make a strong impression.</p>

                <h3>Ask Family and Friends for Referrals</h3>
                <p>Many teen jobs come through personal connections. Let your parents, aunts, uncles, older siblings, and family friends know you are looking for work. If someone in your network works at a business that hires teens, an internal referral can move your application to the top of the pile. This is especially effective in tight-knit communities like Rexdale.</p>

                <h3>Volunteer First to Build References</h3>
                <p>If you are struggling to get hired without any experience at all, volunteering for a few weeks can give you the references and skills that tip the balance. Volunteer at a local community centre, library, food bank, or place of worship, then use that experience and those references on your first real job application.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights as a Young Worker in Ontario</h2>
                <p>As a teenager entering the workforce, you have the same fundamental workplace protections as adult workers. Knowing your rights can help you avoid being taken advantage of in your first job.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minimum wage applies regardless of age:</strong> Ontario's general minimum wage ($16.55/hr as of October 2024) applies to all workers. The student minimum wage ($15.60/hr) only applies to students under 18 working 28 hours or fewer per week during the school year or during school breaks. Your employer must tell you which rate applies to you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Workplace safety protections:</strong> Your employer is required by law to train you on all health and safety hazards in your workplace, provide protective equipment at no cost, and ensure your work environment is safe. Under OHSA, you have the right to refuse unsafe work without being punished.</li>
                    <li><strong>No illegal hours:</strong> If your employer asks you to work during school hours (when you are required to be in school), overnight shifts (if you are under 16), or excessive hours that interfere with your education, you have the right to refuse. Document any requests like this.</li>
                    <li><strong>You cannot be asked to pay for training or uniforms:</strong> Under the ESA, employers generally cannot deduct money from your wages for training costs. Uniforms that are specific to the employer (with a company logo, for example) must be provided at no charge. You may be required to provide basic clothing items like black pants and non-slip shoes, but the employer cannot force you to buy branded items.</li>
                    <li><strong>How to report workplace issues:</strong> If you believe your employer is violating your rights, you can file a complaint with the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development. You can also call the ministry's health and safety hotline at 1-877-202-0008. It is illegal for your employer to fire you or punish you for reporting a workplace issue.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Volunteer Opportunities That Lead to Jobs</h2>
                <p>In Ontario, all high school students need to complete <strong>40 hours of community involvement</strong> to graduate. Instead of just checking a box, use your volunteer hours strategically to build skills and connections that lead directly to paid work.</p>

                <h3>Rexdale Community Hub</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Rexdale Community Hub</strong> on Rexdale Boulevard offers volunteering opportunities in youth programming, event support, community outreach, and administrative assistance. Volunteering here connects you with community leaders and organizations that frequently hire local youth for paid summer and part-time positions.</p>

                <h3>Library Volunteering</h3>
                <p>Toronto Public Library branches in Rexdale and Etobicoke (including the Rexdale branch and Richview branch) have teen volunteer programs where you can help with children's reading programs, shelving, tech help for seniors, and community events. Library staff are excellent references, and the library itself occasionally hires part-time pages and clerks.</p>

                <h3>Community Centre Programs</h3>
                <p>City of Toronto community centres in Thistletown, Humber Summit, and Scarlett Heights regularly seek teen volunteers for after-school programs, sports leagues, and summer camps. These volunteer roles often serve as a pipeline to paid positions -- many camp counsellors started as volunteer assistants at 14 or 15 and were hired at 16.</p>

                <h3>Church, Mosque, and Faith Community Service</h3>
                <p>Religious and faith-based organizations in Rexdale are deeply connected to the local business community. Volunteering at your church, mosque, gurdwara, or temple for events, food drives, or youth programs gives you experience working with diverse groups and access to community members who own businesses and may be hiring.</p>

                <h3>School Clubs and Extracurriculars</h3>
                <p>Leading or actively participating in school clubs (student council, debate team, sports teams, cultural clubs) demonstrates initiative, teamwork, and commitment. These may not count directly as work experience, but employers look for well-rounded candidates, and club involvement shows you can manage responsibilities beyond the classroom.</p>

                            <p>In Ontario, there is no single minimum working age that applies to all jobs. Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), young workers aged 14 and older can be employed in most retail stores, offices, and food service establishments. However, workers must be at least 15 to work in a factory, and at least 16 to work on a construction site. Some jobs in mining and logging require workers to be 18. Many employers in Toronto, including Tim Hortons, McDonald's, and grocery stores like FreshCo and Metro, hire workers starting at age 14 or 15 for limited roles such as cashier, bagger, or dining room attendant.</p>

                            <p>A 14-year-old in Toronto can work in a number of roles that do not involve hazardous conditions. Common jobs for 14-year-olds include fast food crew member at restaurants like Tim Hortons, McDonald's, or Subway (limited to tasks like cashier, dining room cleanup, and food prep that does not involve deep fryers or industrial equipment), grocery store bagger or shelf stocker at FreshCo, Metro, or Food Basics, dog walking and pet sitting in your neighbourhood, tutoring younger students in subjects you excel at, and helping at local community events or programs. Many of these opportunities are available in Rexdale and Etobicoke, especially along Rexdale Boulevard and at Woodbine Mall.</p>

                            <p>Yes, Ontario's minimum wage applies to workers of all ages. There is no lower youth minimum wage in Ontario. As of October 2024, the general minimum wage is $16.55 per hour. This means that whether you are 14, 15, 16, or 17, your employer must pay you at least $16.55 per hour for every hour you work. If you earn tips (for example, working at a restaurant), your employer cannot pay you less than minimum wage and count tips toward making up the difference. The only exception is the student minimum wage of $15.60 per hour, which applies only to students under 18 who work 28 hours or fewer per week during the school year, or work during a school break or summer holiday.</p>

                            <p>In Ontario, the Employment Standards Act does not set a specific maximum number of hours per week for 15-year-olds. However, the Education Act requires that students under 16 attend school, which effectively limits work to after school hours, evenings, and weekends during the school year. Most employers hiring 14 and 15-year-olds will schedule shifts of 3 to 4 hours on school days (typically after 3:30 PM) and up to 8 hours on weekends and holidays. A reasonable guideline is 10 to 15 hours per week during the school year to ensure your grades do not suffer. During summer break and school holidays, 15-year-olds can work longer hours, similar to adult schedules.</p>

                            <p>No, Canadian citizens and permanent residents do not need a work permit to work as a teenager in Ontario. Unlike some other provinces and U.S. states, Ontario does not require a formal work permit or employment certificate for young workers. You also do not legally need your parents' written consent to get a job, although many employers will ask for parental permission as part of their own hiring policy, especially for workers under 16. What you do need before starting any job is a Social Insurance Number (SIN), which you can apply for at any Service Canada office with your birth certificate or other proof of identity. If you are an international student or newcomer, different rules may apply depending on your immigration status.</p>

                            <p>The safest jobs for teenagers are those that do not involve heavy machinery, hazardous materials, or dangerous working conditions. In Rexdale and Etobicoke, some of the safest options include retail cashier or sales associate at stores in Woodbine Mall, grocery store bagger or shelf stocker, tutoring or homework help for younger students, dog walking and pet sitting in your neighbourhood, library volunteer or assistant at Rexdale or Etobicoke library branches, and summer camp assistant at City of Toronto community centres. Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Act specifically prohibits young workers from operating certain types of machinery, working at heights, or handling toxic substances. Your employer is required by law to train you on workplace safety and provide any necessary protective equipment at no cost to you.</p>

                            <p>Yes, a 16-year-old can work at a warehouse in Etobicoke, but with some restrictions. Under Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Act, workers must be at least 15 to work in a factory setting, and many warehouse operations fall under factory regulations. At 16, you are legally permitted to work in a warehouse but you cannot operate forklifts, powered industrial trucks, or other heavy machinery until you are 18 in most cases. Typical warehouse roles available to 16-year-olds include order picking, packing, sorting, and light shipping tasks. Many warehouses and distribution centres near Pearson Airport and along the Highway 27 corridor in Etobicoke do hire 16 and 17-year-olds for these roles, often paying $17-$20 per hour with shift premiums for evenings and weekends.</p>
