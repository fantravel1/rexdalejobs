                <!-- Section: Why Rexdale & Etobicoke -->
                <h2>Why Rexdale &amp; Etobicoke Are Warehouse Job Hotspots</h2>
                <p>The concentration of warehouse work in Rexdale and Etobicoke is no accident. Toronto Pearson Airport is Canada's largest cargo hub, handling over 500,000 tonnes of air freight annually. The goods that arrive by air need to be sorted, stored, and distributed — and that work happens in the warehouses and cross-dock facilities that surround the airport. Companies choose this area because of its unmatched transportation links: Highway 427 provides a direct north-south corridor to the 401 and 407, while Highway 27 connects the industrial zones to the airport's cargo villages.</p>
                <p>Beyond air cargo, Etobicoke's industrial parks serve as distribution hubs for retailers, grocery chains, and e-commerce companies that need to reach customers across the Greater Toronto Area quickly. The result is a diverse mix of employers — from global logistics giants to small Canadian-owned warehouses — all competing for workers. That competition works in your favour: wages have been rising, signing bonuses are common during peak season, and many employers now offer benefits, shift premiums, and referral bonuses to attract and retain staff.</p>
                <p>For residents of Rexdale, North Etobicoke, and surrounding neighbourhoods, the proximity of these jobs is a major advantage. Many warehouses along Belfield Road, Martin Grove Road, and Rexdale Boulevard are within a short bus ride or even walking distance. TTC routes 191 (Highway 27 Rocket), 52 (Lawrence West), and 36 (Finch West) serve the key industrial zones, making <strong>warehouse jobs in Etobicoke</strong> accessible even without a car.</p>

                <!-- Section: Major Employers -->
                <h2>Major Employers: Amazon, UPS, FedEx &amp; More</h2>
                <p>Some of the world's largest logistics companies operate major facilities in and around Etobicoke, creating thousands of warehouse positions throughout the year. Here is an overview of the key employers:</p>
                <p><strong>Amazon warehouse jobs in Toronto</strong> are among the most sought-after. Amazon operates multiple fulfilment centres in the GTA, including facilities in nearby Bolton and Mississauga accessible from Etobicoke. Roles include stower, picker, packer, and sortation associate. Amazon offers competitive starting pay, benefits from day one for full-time employees, and tuition assistance through its Career Choice program.</p>
                <p><strong>UPS jobs in Toronto</strong> are centred around their major package sort facility on Belfield Road in Etobicoke and the Pearson Airport cargo area. UPS hires package handlers, warehouse workers, and driver helpers — especially during the holiday peak season from October through January. UPS is known for promoting from within, and many part-time package handler roles have led to full-time driver and supervisory careers.</p>
                <p><strong>FedEx jobs in Toronto</strong> are available at their Pearson Airport hub and various ground distribution terminals in the Etobicoke and Mississauga area. FedEx Ground, FedEx Express, and FedEx Freight each hire warehouse associates, package handlers, and dock workers. FedEx is recognized for its benefits package and tuition reimbursement program, making it attractive for students and those pursuing further education.</p>
                <p>Other major employers in the area include <strong>Purolator</strong>, <strong>DHL</strong>, <strong>Canada Post</strong>, <strong>Walmart Canada</strong>'s distribution network, <strong>Loblaw</strong> and <strong>Metro</strong> grocery distribution centres, and dozens of third-party logistics (3PL) providers like GoBolt, Day &amp; Ross, and XPO Logistics. Staffing agencies such as Randstad, Adecco, Express Employment, and Manpower also maintain a constant pipeline of warehouse placements in the area.</p>

                <!-- Section: How to Get Started -->
                <h2>How to Get Started in Warehouse Work</h2>
                <p>Getting your first warehouse job in Etobicoke is straightforward, even if you have no previous experience. Most entry-level positions — packer, order picker, and general labourer — require only a positive attitude, physical fitness, and the ability to stand and lift for extended periods. Here is a practical roadmap to landing your first role:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prepare your resume.</strong> Keep it simple. Highlight any work experience (even outside of warehousing), your availability for different shifts, and any relevant skills like forklift certification, WHMIS training, or familiarity with inventory systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Register with staffing agencies.</strong> Agencies like Randstad, Adecco, and Express Employment have offices in and around Etobicoke and specialize in warehouse placements. They can often place you within 24 to 48 hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply directly to major employers.</strong> Visit amazon.jobs, upsjobs.com, and fedex.com/en-ca/careers for the latest openings. Many companies also post positions on Indeed and LinkedIn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get forklift certified.</strong> If you want to earn higher wages, invest in a forklift operator licence. Training courses are available locally for $100-$250 and can be completed in 1-3 days. Counterbalance and reach truck certifications open the most doors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Obtain safety training.</strong> WHMIS (Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System) certification is required at many warehouses and can be completed online for free or at low cost. First Aid/CPR is also a valuable addition to your resume.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be flexible on shifts.</strong> Afternoon and overnight shifts are often easier to get hired for and typically pay $1-$3/hr more than day shifts. Weekend availability also increases your chances significantly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The warehouse industry in Etobicoke offers real career progression. Many supervisors, operations managers, and logistics coordinators started as general labourers or order pickers. If you show up on time, work hard, and express interest in learning, advancement opportunities will follow.</p>
